Born in Nybor, then leaving as soon as he was 10, to a small town in the forest, he was already unfamiliar with his surroundings. Descended from fallen angels, he never truly fit in. All his life, people had ridiculed him because of his silver hair. They all said it was grey. Abaewin’s parents were never around, always leaving him to his own devices.When he was 20, he would wander in dark places. He didn’t realize they were dark, but it was a place where he could get some peace and quiet, away from other people.  One day, he saw a woman in the woods, and she seemed to be trying to hide in plain sight for some reason. He said “Hello”, and she jumped and said “How can you see me?”. Abaewin said “What do you mean? It’s not that dark, and you’re not trying to hide.” The woman responded “What do you mean not that dark? I can barely see! Oh… are you one of those people descended from fallen angels?” “Yes”, replied Abaewin, “But I don’t seem to have gotten anything out of it, other than my gray hair”. The woman said “My name’s Zinnoara Galantara, and I might be able to teach you a thing or two. You seem to need some guidance. Or education.” Abaewin responded “My parents aren’t around much… I guess I could learn from you.” (Abaewin wasn’t exactly street smart...) Abaewin stayed with Zinnoara for quite some time, hermited away in the woods. Because of this, he wanted more. He had tasted power, as a young child, and wanted his freedom once more. He wanted it all.  His parents died when he was gone, but he never found out, as he didn’t have any love for his parents, not understanding why they were never home. But they were good people, and a large group of Divs had stormed the town, slaughtering the whole thing. The Divs were evil, and knew that Abaewin’s parents were Peris. Abaewin took after his ancestors, though, instead of his parents. The fallen angels. If not for that, the Divs would have come long ago. However, if Abaewin had been there, he would have been killed. Anyways, Abaewin stayed and trained with Zinnoara for 50 years. His appearance didn’t change too much, but Zinnoara grew old and died. He learned much about the world he was in, but was just starting down the path of the arcane arts when Zinnoara died. He mourned her for quite some time, then left to find a new path for himself.   As he travelled, he came across a group of Sczarni. They adopted him into the family, thinking he was a normal human wizard, and he travelled with them for some time. They gifted him a pet, a small snake. Abaewen named it Meeka. 10 years later, Abaewin had learned much from his adopted family, including a few family friends in a town called Sandpoint. This turned out to be good, as one night, the family was attacked by bandits, and Abaewin was driven out, distracting the bandits long enough for the family to flee. Abaewin decided to travel to Sandpoint, as it was the only place he knew of where he could be safe. When he arrived at Sandpoint, he found the family friend, a ruthless thug named Jubrayl Vhiski at the Fatman’s Feedbag. Abaewin stayed at the Feedbag for 6 years, doing odd jobs around the place. During his stay, he learned about the locals, and a few tricks of the trade."}]}

Jasna is an Aasimar Fighter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jas grew up in the city of Vier as the daughter of a dyer and a hunter of exotic beasts. Her parents were loving and her home cramped but comfortable. With both a keen sense of justice and uncommon size and strength from a young age, Jas spent a lot of her childhood beating up neighborhood bullies. Her peers regarded her with a mixture of fear and respect, the proportions of which varied depending on how likely they were to earn her ire. She didn’t make friends easily, and her clear divine heritage only increased her distance from the other children. Although she’s not naturally a solitary person, Jas learned to entertain herself, whether by reading history or honing her physical skills.  When she was 16, Jas chased down a burglar who had stolen from a neighbor and hit him so hard that, in the middle of a public street, he flew back and slammed into a wall. She didn't kill him, but it was frightening enough that she and her parents decided she should join the military to receive training and learn discipline.  The military suited Jas--she loved the hierarchy, the routine, the sense of doing what was right. As someone highly athletic, committed to following the rules, and with a commanding presence, she excelled. She spent ten years in the army, rising from teenage enlisted soldier to officer.  Just before her next promotion, however, a scandal broke. The country Vier is located in, Mohrany, used to be united with their neighbor, Sacreden. The Sacredi ambassador, it turned out, had been secretly gathering intelligence and compiling lists of Mohranian citizens who would be eligible for a draft (the draft is currently not in use in Mohrany, but used to be, and is highly controversial). When this was discovered, a fellow soldier got ahold of the information and anonymously leaked it to the public. This was illegal, a clear breach of the code of conduct and of confidentiality, and Jas worried that making public the treachery and subsequent embarrassment of a sometimes unfriendly ally would cause a war, one in which she or her fellow soldiers would be among the first to die. She took it upon herself to investigate, tracked down the whistleblower, and brought him up on charges in military court.  Then, in court, the goddess that Jas served as an aasimar and as a paladin--Cio, goddess of law, justice, and order--judged her to be in the wrong and cast her down, stripping her of her angelic powers. Jas fell.  Everything collapsed quickly after that. So publicly humiliated, Jas was quietly encouraged to leave the military, and she did. Her loss of faith in Cio, spurred by an inability to understand how a goddess of law could take the side of a lawbreaker over a devoted servant, caused her to lose her paladin powers. She spent a year and a half meandering through Vier's worst dive bars, drinking and getting into fights. She made a few friends, but more enemies.  Jas hit rock bottom when she realized there wasn't a bar in her rotation that she hadn't been kicked out of for fighting. She vowed to clean up her act, and spent time re-learning how to wield a sword without divine power behind it. Soon, she was good enough to look for jobs, and was eventually taken on by the Rana family, new nobility who didn't care about the optics of her past.  She's been working for the Ranas for a year now, and she likes them a lot, but recently she's begun to be suspicious of their adult son, Ere. Figuring out what he gets up to when he disappears might just lead her down a strange path."}]}

When she birthed fraternal triplets the following autumn she recognized them immediately for the Idyllkin that they were and felt their names whispered to her by the providence of the Heavenly realms. Recognizing both the great blessing and responsibility laid upon her, the lone sage set about raising the three girls in a manner befitting their heritage. She lay all of her learning as a scholar of the Master of Masters at their disposal and brought them up knowing endless learning and love.  Nissanai's efforts did not go to waste. The eldest cleaved to the holiness of her god, vowing to protect all good-hearted seekers of knowledge who crossed the treacherous mountain passes. The middle daughter focused on Irori's aspect of honorable self-perfection and enlightenment with a monk's dedication. Then there was Solveig, who was nothing like her sisters and like her mother least of all. For while she respected Irori, she had no patience for the Master of Masters' stern teachings; no patience for anything at all, really. The windy mountains in which she was born infused her with their power, but she had no interest in perfecting her magic through scholarly study. Worldly learning bored her no less. Indeed, the only non-fiction books in her mother's vast library that could hold her interest were military treatises and manuals on hand-to-hand combat, leaving her with a wide array of technical knowledge but little understanding of its practical application. Frequently coming up the loser in sparring matches with her more martially-rigorous sisters never curbed Solveig's enthusiasm, however. When Nissanai passed away at peace with the life she'd led, the girls each felt the blessing their mother had on the day of their birth. They knew the time had come to leave their mountain home and bring the good their mother had brought them up believing in to the troubled outside world. For her part, Solveig knows she is part of a great plan, but worries little about what her next move will be, preferring to let her journey happen as it happens. She rarely plans ahead, getting by on a mix of charm, guile, and bluster. She dresses impractically, flirts recklessly, and spends money without even thinking. She has used her magic to fortify her against the harsh climate of her home constantly rather than learn to cope with it practically, with the unintended side effect that her natural Celestial resistance against certain elements has atrophied away to nothing. But for all her flaws, her heart is pure and full of fearsome and protective love. She does not know what cause for which her Celestial father sired her, but she knows that when she finds it she will defend it with every last drop of her Agathion blood. At 5'11”, Solveig is taller than either of her sisters, with proportions improbable for one so slender. Despite her willowy build, her heavenly heritage endows her with unexpected speed, strength, and stamina. The white stripes on her skin are easily mistaken for body paint, but are in fact pigment as natural as the stripes of a zebra or tiger. Less subtle marks of her heritage are hair a shade of red not found in nature (which lightens to radiant blonde during times of heavy magic use) and eyes the color of electrum coins. Easily mistaken for a woman of low morals and social class, Solveig is more than happy to use her appearance to her advantage right up until the moment when her quarterstaff begins breaking greedy hands and knocking lecherous heads."}]}

Lydia is an Aasimar and has chosen the bard class."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You don't want to hear about me. I'm not very interesting. I can do interesting things and say interesting things, but listening to me talk about me isn't very interesting. The interesting person you want to hear about is my mother.  You may know here. Well, not personally. But you might know her name. Amelia Grace, the Lady Scarlet, singer, mage, musician, magician, muse-gician. One of the most sought after performers in… in… I'm not sure. I don't do well with names and places. Some big, important… thingy.  Maybe the city. Maybe an empire. It's hard to remember, as I was very small at the time, so I would be unlikely to fully recall even if I hadn't had my head cut apart and put back together two or three or twenty five times.  It's very tingly. Kind of refreshing to feel the fresh air blowing over your thoughts.  Mother was not one to cling to fame and fortune with every fiber of her being like some people would. Her life was music and her life was magic, and sometimes when she had time her life was me.  She was always looking into new things, and old things, and old things that were so old that they had been forgotten about and thus had become new again. And one of these things was what would come to be called the Song of Life.  Said to be sung by the very gods themselves when they brought the world into being, through manipulation of the song one could change the growth of crops, affect the breeding of animals, make creatures grow faster, make them stronger, make them faster, make them tougher, make them different.  Make them never die.  Mother traced the echoes of the song, heard them in her dreams. Followed them to a temple in the middle of wilderness, buried beneath sand and soil of the centuries in a place where even the oldest writings say nothing about anyone ever having lived there.  And deep down in the dark, in that unspeakably ancient temple to an unspeakable being of unspeakable power who was unspeakably ancient when the gods were born, she drilled a teeny, tiny hole in reality and for a few brief moments heard something singing the Song itself. Not merely an echo.  She made the hole go away and fled the temple, never to return. Knowing to what extent the Song could be put to use.  But people were listening. Always listening. Trying to understand the echoes of the Song of Life.  So when they heard a few moments of actual singing they took advantage.  Just a little school of magic and music out in the countryside. Not particularly important. Not until they found that could keep things alive, keep them healthy, keep them from dying from old age indefinitely.  Learn how to Sing, learn the notes, the chords, the tones, the tempos to the Song of Life. Sing the right words in the right ways in the right keys and live forever. Sing it loud enough, sing it long enough, and no part of you dies.  There's a term for that. When bits of you that are supposed to die don't, when they keep on living when they shouldn't. It's called cancer. It is not a fun way to die. It is an even fun less way to remain alive.  And they couldn't stop. They had bettered themselves such that their bodies always sang the songs, forever to life, never to die.  And soon the song spread beyond them. Their mere presence making things grow, making things live, making things never die.  Illnesses are alive. Diseases are alive. Plagues are alive. The places in the world that are crammed to the brim with life, the grand cities, the fertile rainforests, they are places where contagions thrive.  Those who sought to never die screamed and wailed in their agonies as their bodies were consumed by virulent sickness. Healing, infecting, rotting, and healing again in an endless cycle of consumption.  Not even the slightest bit of them was allowed to die, not even one hair made to fall away from their heads. They grew, bloated, warped, twisted, becoming less beings and more locations, living rooms, buildings, factories of flesh and bone, belching forth abominations.  It was to this landscape of carnal horror that Mother returned to. And she purged it with fire. Purged it until the valley was glass.  Father was having troubles with the… king? Emperor? Duke? Count? Well, the thing pretending to be him. Some creature was wearing the old king's skin and hiding inside it. Father stayed behind, while Mother took me and we went away.  Away to a pretty little valley filled with simple farmers, remote wilderness, and narrow, easily watched canyons on either side as the sole entrance where she could place guardian beasts just in case the agents of the Skinmask King came calling.  And then one day they did. Once again in search of the Song of Life and its power. Wanting to make perfect soldiers. Immortal soldiers. Undying soldiers.  The King sent his blackest of knights, who slew my mother's dragon, came to the town, burned the town when Mother would not give them what they wanted.  And then Mother did.  Mother sang the Song of Life for them, and then the misty valley was no more.  It was no longer part of the world.  It was where She dwells. Not the composer of the song, but the singer. It's loudest, longest singer who has grown a world's chorus worth of voices in the eternities she has spent, cast between worlds. She was not supposed to live, but she could not die. So she simply was.  In an eternal emptiness there is infinite room to grow, where years are like seconds and seconds are like years.  She gave them what they wanted.  And they killed her for it.  Mother fought them, of course. And they died. And Mother died.  But She brought them back. To watch them. To study them. To experiment with them. Everyone, everything, animal, vegetable, and mineral in that valley.  She cut us apart, put us back together, saw how we worked with other parts. She was curious, wanting to learn. She didn't get new things to experiment on very often, and certainly not in such large numbers.  She found Mother the most interesting, and the most malleable. Mother was already filled with Her song, after all, and She could manipulate her almost as well as She could warp and twist Herself.  She could cut cut cut away the bad parts, keep us normal, make sure that we remained fully functional and intact even as she hacked us to pieces and put us back together.  After a few seconds and a few decades Mother had a moment of lucid clarity where her mind was her own and not merely an extension of She Who Thrives Between. Her body, however, was another story. She lifted me up, drilled a bigger hole in reality, and pushed me through, closing it upon the part of herself that was carrying me.  I left yesterday a little girl, and came back this morning as a grown… mmm, with all the changes, all the bestial alterations, would I still be classified as a woman, do you think? Perhaps if I had a few more scales and a bit more snout I would be called a grown dragoness.  I don't have my mother's gift for magic. I cannot cast spells, summon beasts, and bind creatures to my will as she did. And for this I am thankful, as it means that I cannot truly sing the Song of Life that can cause such horrors upon the world. I don't know the words.  I think Mother cut the words out of my head when she was taking me apart and putting me back together, made to act as a puppet with Her hand inside.  I can make living things listen to me, I can change them. I can make them dance to my tune.  Music can only suggest a mood, it takes words to state the way that something truly is.  I can't do that. I don't want to do that. I won't do that.  I will use the tune, but I'll be using my own lyrics, thank you very much.  Have you ever realized that you'd be really, really cute with a tail, by the way?  Here, let me show you..."}]}

Rarely was there a reason to pay them any attention and not worth the risk of angering the village's aquatic allies. The day Captain Harlot heard rumors of a small boy who could change the winds during a tantrum that he decided the reward was worth it. They found the boy easily enough playing on the docks. He was the only Half-Elf with blue hair and skin to be seen. With only minimal bloodshed, the pirates returned to the ship, the boys screams nearly causing the rowboat to capsize numerous times by conjures waves on a calm sea. Captain Harlot took him in and raised the boy as her own, treating him with all the love he could want, assuring him that she world protect him form all the mean pirates and convincing him that life with her was better than life in the fishing village. It was all a lie though. Captain Harlot had instructed the crew to torment the boy so she could play hero. She cultivated a loyal and strong and deadly sorcerer. Illithrian learned the truth when he was 16, when he overheard one of the old crew explaining to a new recruit the whole story. Illithrian set the ship on fire, rowboats and all.   He dove overboard and swam 3 miles to shore. He wandered, exhausted, into the nearest pub and ordered \"A whiskey on the roughest day of his life\" and kept drinking until someone bumped into him. He turned around, punching a massive Goliath right in the ribs. A bit offput by this tiny boy taking a swing at him, Momak hesitated until the boy decided to swing with a follow through. Illithrian was soundly beaten but before he went down he released a burst of thunderous force, knocking everyone around him back. Seeing potential in the kid, the captain of Momak's ship called the fight off and invited Illithrian aboard as a member of his crew. No strings attached, Illithrian freely offered his services to the crew, though to this day 2 years later he still thinks Momak is going to murder him in his sleep."}]}

Ayeru is a human paladin."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ayeru lived with her mother most of her life, as her father was off fighting in the army. They lived in a small village, Mirefield, within the kingdom of Vale. Around the time Ayeru was seven years old, Mirefield was plagued by famine. Ayeru's mother would always insist that Ayeru eat more than her. She claimed it was because Ayeru needed the nourishment to grow and she didn't. After a year, many had perished and others were on the verge of death. Ayeru and her mother were among them. Ayeru watched as her mother slowly starved to death, always giving Ayeru what little food they had. Without her mother around to care for her, Ayeru soon met the same fate.  Yet, that is not the end of her tale. She soon sprung awake on a cold stone table, looking at a high roof. As she looked around, she spotted a white bearded man, dressed in a dark robe. He was delighted to see she was alive and well. She felt alive and better, now, but felt very different, at the same time. As she continued to scan the room she saw a figure crumpled on the floor. It appeared to be human, but with cat-like features. She felt like she knew the creature, but could quite tell why. The wizard told her that he was pleased things went better this time and that he could fix the problems from his first attempt. He apologized that, sadly, her mother did not survive the experiment. Then, it hit her like a brick wall. The thing lying on the ground, that twisted corpse, was her mother. The wizard did all he could on consul her and keep her calm. After assuring her that everything would be alright, he left and returned with food, water, and a mirror. He handed Ayeru the mirror before anything else, telling her to have a look. She looked in the mirror to see that she now had cat ears atop her head, whiskers on her face, fur covering her body, claws coming out her fingers, and a tail extending out of her back. She was different, but at least she was alive. Over the following year, the wizard took care of Ayeru. His name was Xavallan Reonro. Ayeru had lost a lot of her memory, but would regain the occasional fragment. Xavallan may have cared for her, but he was no father. He would subject her to the tests and write reports about the results. To him, she was no longer a person. She was his creation. His pet. Eventually, Ayeru grew tired of this, and fled the tower by cover of the night. She ran as far away as she could. She swore vengeance against Xavallan. She promised to end him before he could hurt others the way he hurt her and her mother. However, living on her own was not easy. She was shunned by many simply because of her looks. She lived on the streets, eating rodents and trash like an animal, for that's what she was to them, an animal. She soon began stealing and burgling to make money. Her cat-like abilities made this easy for her. One day, she was spotted crawling out of a rather secure house's basement. Her spotter approached her with an opportunity. She could join a spy ring and make good money stealing information. She would be given somewhere to live, somewhere to belong. She excitedly agreed and began her new life as a spy. She was a prodigy. She could easily hide in plain sight with the right disguise. She got information as fast as she could and got out as soon as she could. She outed corrupt artisans. Destroyed evil aristocrats. She was finally making a difference in the world. Until, she slipped up. Loftaren had necromancer problems for years, and when it was found out that a local wizard and shopkeep was conspiring with them, all magic and magic casters were banned from the city. Yet, the lord of the city, Evandir, was a sorcerer himself. Ayeru was tasked to fix this. Reveal his secret and get him thrown away. And she did exactly that. She got the information she needed to prove his guilt and got him thrown in prison. The only problem was, he was a fine leader, but those who replaced him, were not. The military stepped in and took over. They were cruel, harsh, and abusive. The people wanted them out, but could do nothing. So, Ayeru set out to fix her mistake. She went around, disguising herself to be near nobles and the like in hopes of finding a group of adventurers to aid her. Or better yet, a group with the same goal in mind."}]}

He is the last child of the last child of the last child, last in line for the position of \"Arch\" within a noble Svirfneblin family, but yet is still the great-grandson and direct line of current Patriarch, Orthan Fu-Finfergel. The family's secret name is “Fu,” a name which nobody knows outside of the family or the family’s superiors (if there are any). Also, due to the secrecy of the Deep Gnome hierarchy, only a few people in the family have an inkling of what the family’s position, role, and duties are, and only one, the current Patriarch, knows for sure.  Due to his low stature within the family and near crippling shyness that was only overcome in bursts of anger and awkwardness, he was useless for diplomatic or honorific duties. Because of this, he left his family to take the only honorable path that seemed possible for him - joining the Deep Gnome monastery in a region of the Underdark that is close to lava flows and volcanoes. Members of the monastery tend to be elementally attuned to earth or fire. The natural silence and the disciplines of training and harnessing the energy of the self and of the elemental forces within the volcanoes allowed him to downplay his weaknesses and hone his abilities. Upon joining the monastery, he began to learn the fire arts and martial traditions of the Svirfneblin, earning the Deep Gnome Monastic name of \"Kaeryim,\" or \"Kindlepalm\" in Common speech.    Not long after being initiated into the ways of the Elemental Fire Monk, a tragedy struck him. When wandering on his own through some of the deepest and hottest magma chambers of the area, he was surprised, overpowered, knocked (or magicked) unconscious, and abducted. He woke to find himself trapped in a locked box, stripped of all possessions, and with no memory of who or what had surprised him. He was transported in that state for so long as to become completely unaware of how far from home he was.   After what seemed forever, he was somehow made unconscious again, and awoke in the mouth of a cave with no entrance to the Underdark, looking at the sun for the first time ever. Lost, disoriented, and traumatized, all he wants to do is find his way back to his monastery and live in peace.    He has been traveling above under the name “Kindle,\" looking for a way back to the Underdark, staying out of the way of most settlements most times, and making every attempt to pass unnoticed. He only ventures into a city, where he would clearly and uncomfortably stand out if surface dwellers were to see him clearly, if survival necessitates.  At times, though, his desire for anonymity is overwhelmed by his lawful nature, and his sense of justice compels him to intervene on behalf of others, especially if someone seems to be lost or victimized, like himself. And he has become quite courageous, if not somewhat paranoid, in the face of threats - never wanting to again be as helpless as he was.   Mostly, though, he is looking for telltale holes in the ground."}]}

Spyrok stuck with it for the better part of the year, doing whatever good he could despite the less than favorable situation. That is until the day came when his CO went too far, by burning down a village just because a stray dog mistook him for a latrine. Spyrok gave into his draconic instincts for the first time in his life, proceeding to knock him out cold with a single, powerful punch to the head, and immediately resigning from active duty. Knowing he couldn’t return home at risk of endangering his friends or family, he sent a message to them warning them to evacuate as soon as they could. He then took up the mantle of sellsword, but only taking jobs from those without evil intentions, and for those that do, they can meet the business end of a scaly fist.  "}]}

Until I ran away from home at 14 to join the Navy. As a starry-eyed, sharp-toothed youngster, I turned up to the office, where they turned me down. So I turned to the next best thing, a mercenary crew defending merchant ships from pirates. They were wary of me at first, but on a ship, everyone pulls their weight, and we got along fine. Not much happened, since the pirates went after the merchants who didn't hire armed escorts. The lingering smell of alcohol on my breath earned me the name \"Boozebreath\". So they tried to get me drunk. After a barrel or two to overcome my resistance to poison, I was properly drunk. And then I took a dare to walk off the plank. Again, I was 15. To add to my misfortunes, I scraped myself against a railing. The blood spread through the waters, drawing the attention of a nearby shark. Drunk and foolhardy, I stared it down as it approached, and punched it across the face. As the shark began to bleed, I began to get angrier. And that was the first time I flew into a rage, tearing the shark's teeth and fins out. I returned to the ship, corpse over my shoulder, and got even more drunk. I spent another few years on the ship, keeping my shark souvenirs close at hand. 8 years after, the pirates finally grew bold enough to attack the ship I was on, in the middle of the night. They fought their way onto the ship, taking it over and slaughtering our crew. They kept me alive, bound and restrained, uncertain how to kill me as I frothed and shrugged off blows from their blades. When they left me alone, I melted the restraints with my spit, both the ropes and the guards. And then, with my axe, a piece of flint, and a pile of gunpowder, I brought the ship down with us."}]}

As such he had little to no chance of ever claiming inheritance or gaining political sway.   Instead, his family deemed it best to send him as an Offering to the Church of Bahamut, a political pawn in his Clan’s machinations.  When he was four he was pierced with the signs of his Clan, the Mother of Pearls which cast across his brow.  When he was five, his Clan abandoned him to the teachings of Bahamut.    It was there that Jerreth was disciplined and tutored in the religious teachings of Bahamut under the guidance of his Mentor, Yorskan Hammerwing.  The other children quickly learned of his situation, and mockingly titled him “Gift.”  It was from a young age he took that mockery and claimed it as his own, gaining an air of superiority and boasting that he was “A Gift from Bahamut himself.”  He grew up cloistered and kept away from any other race than Dragonborn, and thus thought of anything different from himself as inferior.  While his family had intended for him to become a politically influential member of the Clergy, such as a prominent advisor, Jerreth was a poor student.  Through his own wishes and encouragement by his Mentor, he was instead ranked as a Blade of the Church, a soldier.  He knew his vacancy at the top would allow other members to fill his seat, and allowed them to squabble and plot amongst themselves.  He was happy with a sword in hand.  When he turned 10, he began his martial training.  His religious education and guidance in life continued under Yorskan.   When Jerreth entered adulthood, he spent much of his time on military missions. He became gravely wounded in a battle and loss the colorization of his Right Eye.  He was rescued and kept alive by Fenzys Nogard, a battle medic, but spent much time kept from further battle.  While recovering, he aided Fenzys in healing the wounded.  It was during that time their relationship developed, and was humbled when he realized that many of the wounded she tended to were not Dragonborn, but of others that had been cast aside in their society.  He vowed that he would not let harm come to any Good creature, even those not of his kind.  This did not completely eliminate his sense of superiority, however, much to Fenzys dismay.  It finally came time for Jerreth to formally take his oath, becoming a member of the Holy Order of Bahamut as a Paladin and Adjudicator.

Clan is reasonably insular, trades with dwarves in mountain mines and plains farmers.  Immediate family came from martial sect of the clan; maternal grandfather was Vargachwiq - lit. battle-tower, one selected to be rallying point in battle and standard-bearer. Tradition is for 3 oldest hatchlings to also enter martial sect - no choice given for future, as there is for younger siblings in the clutch. Andumar is 2nd son; older brother Kuru, 3rd oldest is sister Meten. Never had much to do with 16 younger clutchmates - family saw them as secondary and kept them seperate. Most went into priesthood to attend clan shrine to Bahamut.  Basic training in discipline, agility, fitness given in early years - at coming of age (16yrs), each member of martial sect given weapons crafted by clan leader, Bhazzaruan. Kuru - master archer, received silver inlaid warbow; Meten - impulsive and dangerous, got twin battleaxes. Andumar received glaive - always enjoyed polearms and their like.  Martial sect initiates are given the choice:  - remain with the clan to learn from the older warriors, and have a higher chance of mating, carrying on line - leave to learn from other races, see the world and bring back knowledge and/or riches for the clan.  Kuru stayed - more dutiful son, most favoured by father. Haven't seen him for 16 years (1/2 current lifespan).  Meten and Andumar set out together - were always closer with each other than with Kuru, possibly due to hatching within seconds of each other (Kuru a few hours older). Set out west to reach Sword Coast and see the sea spoken of by others who returned from learning. Split up after 4 years (12 years ago) when Meten took a post as a ship captain's bodyguard, operating out of Waterdeep.  Andumar took up with a mercenary troop in the same area, commanded by half-elf Steri One-Ear. Learned a lot from One-Ear, in getting paid as much as in martial skill. Rose to rank of sergeant [or equivalent], in charge of a dozen - troop size variable depending on needs, usually around 60. Band travelled up and down coast, taking on contracts and recruits wherever possible, sometimes in morally grey areas. Andumar's cloak came from the contract where he got his last promotion, taking out a notorious orc raiding band. Orc standards are not easy to come by. Retired when agreed term of ten years was up; left with collection of weapons & armour (warhammer, shield, chainmail, cloak, manacles, rank insignia, cash, etc.). Headed to Waterdeep in hope that Meten was in port - heard stories of her ship, but had set sail months before his arrival. Set out east to return to clan. Was a few months into journey when he woke up in Barovia."}]}

Shortly before adolescence he was sold into indentured servitude to dwarves for the necessary medicine, likely saving lives. But the clan got wiped out by a warring clan soon after, and Lorob stayed on with the dwarves and grew up alongside his \"brother,\" Dain Loderr. They trained to be warriors, and when their skills exceeded the needs of the peaceful Loderr, Lorob and Dain took to the road and the life of adventuring.  They soon fell in with a skilled band: Shava Xiloscient, an elven druid who knew the personal names of every animal in her forest, and Andry Tealeaf, a halfling rogue who couldn't speak but seemed to know everyone's secrets. Dain took the lead as a fighter with impeccable use of his waraxe, and Lorob kept them all safe with his shield and the scant paladin training he had received as a child. Together they had a handful of successful missions, and it seemed that they might make a name for themselves amongst the intelligent races.  But the group was not so harmonious as outsiders may have believed. Shava and Dain bickered endlessly, the elf favoring over-caution and the dwarf favoring quick, decisive action. Secretly, Lorob often thought Shava made a lot of sense, and he often wondered at the raw natural power wielded by this elf maiden he found so appealing. But Dain was his brother, and rather than side with Shava, Lorob intentionally pitted them against one another, in part for amusement and in part so he could spend more time exploring his feelings. The fighting got worse, Shava grew to distrust Dain's increasingly reckless leadership, Andry grew more sullen and removed, and it seemed the entire party was liable to split after the next mission. When they entered the old tombs to clear a few undead, the only person anyone was willing to speak with was Lorob, and even Dain seemed to do so begrudgingly. Lorob realized the risk of losing his found family and agonized over what to do-- perhaps so much that he missed the clues that they were walking into a trap.  There was a necromancer, it seemed, or perhaps a cult. Whatever it was, the tombs had far more than the few skeletons they had expected. By the time Lorob realized they were under attack, Andry was already surrounded by wights, frantic and silent as they drained her life. Dain charged forward and fell into a pit trap, and when Shava tried to retreat, something grabbed her leg and dragged her into a pool of water. Lorob tried to save each, tried to put himself between the monsters and his friends, but it was a losing battle. Each team member fought their own fight, and then they each died. Dain was the last: when the wights followed him into the pit, he ordered Lorob flee. Lorob followed the order.  Lorob existed in a state of rage for the next month. He needed funds to gather up another adventuring party to clear the tombs and recover his friends' bodies, but he could not get the village to pay for what they saw as a botched mission. So he went deep into debt with usurers to pay for a second expedition, this one large and more than enough to defeat any wights. They succeeded in retrieving the bodies of Lorob's former team, the team accepted its pay, and then they moved on. Lorob laid his friends to rest, taking a few keepsakes from each: Andry's Tealeaf dagger, Dain's waraxe, and Shava's spear. He also kept Shava's necklace, a glass sphere with a small autumn leaf suspended within, which she told him symbolized the lost beauty of the ancient elven gods. Something about that resonated with him, and it comforted him during many nights.  But Lorob could not mourn forever, nor could he go long without paying his debts. Under pressure from the usurers, Lorob took employment with a guild he'd never heard of, \"AchieveWorks SuccessPath,\" who offered him upfront payment in exchange for protective services and some sort of specialized training. Lorob had low expectations, but he was amazed to find that the AWSP team had all the answers he needed! He could be a success again, make a difference and help people, and all it took was AWSP's 9 Step Program towards Building a Better You. After he finished his mandatory training, Lorob enrolled in the 13 Paths to Teamwork course, then the 22 Building Blocks of Workplace Synergy. Soon he was a licensed merchant for AWSP, hosting seminars and moonlighting as a guard for AWSP's growing coffers. In his free time he tried to learn more about the elven gods from temples and books, and all his study and growth made Lorob feel like a new man.  Finally, Lorob gained license to recruit and market the AWSP way on his own. He tried traditional marketing and seminars, but eventually found that he longed to care for and protect a new group of warriors, to save them from the inefficiencies and lack of teamwork that had plagued his group. And so he is in search of a band of adventurers, where he can return to doing good in the world and maybe spread the methods of AWSP to all who would listen."}]}

A green dragonborn, born with his brothers Zozo, a blue dragonborn, and Jojo, a white dragonborn, has always been a very interesting character. Growing up in his dragonborn clan, he was raised to be a warrior like his forefathers, but he never really had his heart in it. He always prefered (attempting) to make music with anything he could find with his brothers. Seeing how they weren't interested in hand to hand combat , the elders decided at their 7th birthday that Bobo and his brothers might be better suited for magic. They all thoroughly enjoyed playing with magic, but never utilized it to its full capabilities. But one day, playing with some fire magic in a field, they discovered something truly fascinating. They burned a patch of plants near them, but they didn’t smell like normal burning. Upon further inspection, they realized they’ve never seen this plant before. But they didn’t think much of it, mostly because they kept on sniffing the burning air, and as they kept on inhaling, the less they cared and the more they sniffed and the less they cared and the more they sniffed… until they were all on the ground laughing without a care in the world. “What is this stuff?” said Zozo. “I don’t know but we gotta take some home!” said Jojo. “What should we call it though?” said Bobo. After a pause all three brothers came up with the same answer after just a minute “Weed!” They all cried.  Little did they know this was just the beginning of their adventure with this magical plant known as “weed”. For 3 years they kept their “weed” a secret, during which, everyday after training they would sneak out in the night and smoke their weed, which they learned how to grow properly, along with learning that drying it first makes it easier to smoke, as does rolling it up in a thin paper. They also discovered that during their smoke, they played their music ten times better than ever before, with Zozo playing a stolen lyre, Jojo on a bamboo flute, and Bobo on a bearskin drum. One day, they decided that they were going to run away to a big city and become the best performers in the land, and they did just that at only 10 years old. All they brought were clothes, some rations, about 300 gold pieces, their instruments, and all the weed they could hold. Upon arriving at Mon, the largest city for 100 miles, they soon discovered that they would need a place to stay and perform. Now as 3 dragonborn boys in a primarily human city, they were truly an oddity, so upon arriving at the main tavern in town, they asked the barkeep if they could perform there for some food and a room. Now this barkeep had thought he’d seen everything, but certainly not this. He took a liking to them immediately and told them to set up in 5 minutes and perform. They got on the podium and were ready to perform. Everyone was gathering around to hear the music of three dragonborns. Just one more step to prepare for the brothers… as they all lit up their rolls everyone in the bar collectively gasped. “Get out of here with that reeking drug!” yelled the barkeeper “This is a respectable establishment!” Confused, the brothers ran out of the tavern clutching their instruments. As they ran out with their instruments in one hand and their weed in another, they were stopped by a peculiar looking man who reeked of the smell of weed. “Hey little guys, are you lost?” he asked. “No, not really, we just got kicked out of a tavern for smoking these though.” replied Bobo. “You don’t say? Let me see those.” Asked the man. As Bobo handed his over to the man, he instantly recognized it, “Oh! You boys smoke weed! No wonder you got kicked out!” He laughed, “Here, let me show you a place where you can smoke and play, names Gareneous by the way, but everyone calls me Gary.” So Gary led the brothers down a few blocks and a few turns until they came upon a door in the ground. Upon entering, the dragonborn knew that these were their people. Everyone in the place was smoking a roll similar to theirs, and it smelled like their smoke everywhere.   Bobo, Zozo, and Jojo fit in perfectly, they were an oddity, being dragonborns, but also because their music was just so great and never got old. They learned all about “weed culture” and all the different types of weed and different ways of smoking it.  After 5 years of living with the weed group, Gary came up to Bobo one day and asked him, “Bobo, how much do you know about magic?” “Not much” replied Bobo “Me and my brothers used to know a bit before we ran away from our clan.” “Oh ok, so I assume you’ve never heard of magic music then?” Gary asked. “No I can’t say I have, I’ve been told my music is magic though.” answered Bobo. “Well that’s just it!” replied Gary, “Yours and your brothers music has the potential to become true magic! You could be the most powerful bards in the world! You especially, which is why I made you this.” Gary unveils his present, which he had invisible on the table, a large green glass bong, with bongos put into the middle of the shaft. “This” proclaimed Gary, “Is a magical bong I made specifically for you. It can not break, can not be lost, and allows you to combine your two passions, smoking and music! But with this, it will also completely unlock your full magical potential.” “This is great!” exclaimed Bobo, “So I just get to have it?” “Yeah! But I do need you to do something for me though.” said Gary “There’s a forest to the east of here, about a week’s travel, and I need you to go there and deal with a problem there. Only you can do it.” “Uh are you sure?” Asked Bobo, “I mean I just play drums and smoke I don’t know what I could really do…” “Trust me, you can do it, also you need to leave immediately, good luck!” replied Gary as he snapped his fingers, and teleported Bobo to the east entrance to the city with food, water, supplies, weed, and his bong. Seeing no other option, Bobo headed East to this forest.  Upon reaching the forest in question Bobo saw immediately what the problem was, and it was terrifying. A giant brown gorilla was rampaging around the forest, knocking everything over and terrorizing all the animals on the forest. “What does Gary think I can do about this gorilla?” He thought to himself, “Maybe it might have something to do with this bong, not like I know any magic though.” So Bobo followed close behind him, but far enough away so the gorilla could not see him. Eventually, as the sun was setting, the gorilla decided to head to his home, which turned out to be a rather sophisticated abode, built above the tree line with a cave for support. After an hour or so of the gorilla entering the home, Bobo entered the cave to find what was hidden in there, and in there he found a huge pile of bananas! But Bobo took too long admiring the bananas, and as he turned around he saw the ape looming over him, and upon closer inspection found he wore a red necktie with the letters “DK” written on them. Bobo did the only thing he could in that moment, and took a huge hit from his bong, and played his bongos like no tomorrow. As it turned out the gorilla had bongo’s too and played along with him. They played all through the night and were able to communicate with the beats of the drums, during which Bobo learned that DK was angry because he couldn’t find any more bananas, which he needs to live. They both went to sleep however covered in used banana peels. In the morning then, Bobo went outside the cave to start the day off right, with weed. He leaned up against a tree and began to blow smoke into the leaves. But the most interesting thing happened just then, the tree started growing more bananas instantly all over the branches! Knowing the struggle of his friend DK, he decided to help him, so he went around to every banana tree in the area and blew nice large smoke clouds into the leaves so they would all sprout bananas. A few hours later DK woke up and noticed what had happened and became ecstatic, he almost accidentally crushed Bobo! DK then went out and picked all the banana’s that he could and brought them back to his cave. That night they feasted on bananas, weed, and music. This went on for nearly 7 years, during which DK, which was short for Donkey Kong, also made a weed garden for Bobo and taught him the little magic he knew. But one day Gary showed up again and told Bobo it was time for another adventure, telling him to go the north where there will be a town that is in need of him. Unfortunately this exit was not as quick as last time, so Bobo had to explain to DK why he had to go, and how when Gary says he needs to go somewhere, he must go there, after all that was how they met. After a long gorilla-hug-filled goodbye, with promises to return, Bobo set off on yet another adventure.  It took almost a year, but one day, as Bobo was hotboxing a forest, a paladin showed up, asking for help with a town under attack. Bobo was unsure if this is what Gary wanted him to do, but nothing else occurred so this must be it. Little did he know this adventure would be nothing like his previous ones…  All he knows is that there is one thing he wants, weed, and DK. "}]}

A natural engineer, he kept the clan mining machines running as efficiently as possible, while making improvements wherever he could.

Gleaning enough details from the human, he set to work experimenting with different combinations of the chemicals until finally coming up with the best mixture. After more testing, his black explosive powder was ready for a demonstration.   Obviously unable to keep the testing of his new discovery a secret, dwarves gathered from all over town to see what had become known as \"Gunn-powder\", in action. As the crowds gathered and Thrakk went through his final checks, a group of dwarves were making sure that the show didn't go as planned. The town had always been governed by more traditional groups, and worried that this new Gunn-powder might put hard working miners out of a job, they paid a group to secretly sabotage the explosive charges Thrakk had painstakingly assembled. Unaware of this treachery, Thrakk was ready to go. With his family beside him, and the town watching on, he ignited the charges.  After the dust had cleared, the scene was one of devastation. The charges, rather than detonating in a controlled fashion, had blown shards of granite and ore throughout the chamber. Scores of dwarves laid injured or dying, blood covering the floor and walls. Angry at this disaster, the clan leader; Brazk Ironbeard, bellowed for Thrakk's arrest. Thinking quickly, and with the guards still reeling from the shock of the explosions, Thrakk made his escape.

For I, the youngest son of Ragnor, are the last living member of the Strongarm Clan.  Being the youngest by 50 years, I was allowed to travel to Blackrock and learn the craft of forging. My elder brothers, Ramon and Rickar, and my elder sister Rulvana, stayed in Stonemire to assist father and my Mother, Ramila, helping them run the family business. We had just been risen to Lords of Stonemire, and the children of Lords are sent away to learn from the masters of Blackrock in their chosen field of study. I would spend 30 years at the forge, hearing of the deeds of the Hammers and the Majesty of the Allhammer himself. I began talking to the other Clansman as well. It was here I saw the truth about my Clan, about what we really were. I knew we were low, but if only 1 percent of things I was being told about my Clan were true, we were in fact the lowest. Others would mock me with these facts, my time in Blackrock was lonely with few friends or celebrations.   I vowed that when I returned home, I would leave the Clan and cut ties for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, I never got that chance.

There were no survivors but I.   I did not feel saddened by their deaths. I was instead saddened that I'd never be able to tell them how horrible they were. So, I buried what I could find of them and said a short prayer to the Allhammer and left. They were my kin after all. As I left a thought came to my mind. I was free from their name. And I could make it my own. The Strongarm's of the past were all gone. I'm the only one to survive and I can do anything I wish with it. I feel no hatred for their killers. If it wasn't them that day, it would have been someone else later. I forgive them and leave their judgement to the Allhammer.   So, I will raise up the name, build it upon a sturdy foundation of decency and respect. Use the timbers of truth and stone of honour to build its walls. And it will rejoice in the flames of the Allhammer's Soul forge for eternity. My Vengeance will be honour!   The City Guard have put me in a cell for my own protection.

Alvin's baldness and scraggly, patchy beard, are the result of prolonged exposure to radiation when he was young.# "}]}

Our once respected name was struck from the records and our guild membership revoked.  I was very young when this occurred and don't remember much but my brothers and father all remember our home fondly.    We moved to (nearby town) and continued doing what we did best, blacksmithing. It was a decent life, but I was restless, often getting into fights. When I got older, that upgraded to petty crime and backalley brawls. That changed when my father decided to go into business with Arl, a Halfling merchant with a gift for finding customers who didn't mind our non-guild status. We were more prosperous, to be sure, but the Halfling's sister Anelia was what had the most effect on me.  We fell in love instantly and married within a year of meeting each other. Her only demand was that I leave the fighting behind. She had no stomach for violence and couldn't stand the thought of growing old with someone who fought like I did. For a while it wasn't too hard. I focused more on helping at the smith, but over the years the restlessness returned. Even the birth of our daughter Vinna wasn't enough to quell the urges I felt.  When the rebellion started and the opportunity to regain our name was offered, my brothers were the first to sign up. I barely cared about the rebellion and didn't have any real connection to the home we'd left behind so long ago, but I joined anyway. I told Anelia it was for my family but really it was because I wanted to pick up my hammer again. She didn't buy it, or maybe she didn't care. We argued for days before I simply packed up and left.  I played a very small part in the war. My brothers and I being relegated to supporting the true, honorable warriors. But when our camp was attack we took up arms just the same and were captured along with the rest of them. When the rebellion ended and we returned, bearing the brand that each captured soldier received, the Dwarven high clans begrudgingly upheld their end of the deal and restored my family's name. My father and the two brothers who survived the rebellion returned to (Dwarf city) immediately, but I went back to (nearby town), expecting my wife and daughter to welcome me with open arms.  Arl told me that, while I was gone, Anelia and Vinna were caught up in one of the many anti-dwarf riots that occurred during the rebellion, and were both killed. Enraged, but not wanting to dishonor her memory, I fled the town and made it five miles into the wilderness before letting loose. Decades passed in a blur of violence, rage, and squalor.   I had taken up with a group of bandits who raided caravans when my life changed for a second time. We attacked a small group of what we thought would be easy prey, but turned out to be clerics to the god of war and conflict. They easily repelled us, but while the rest of my group ran away I stayed and fought. They must have seen something in me because, after knocking me unconscious, I awoke in their camp, being tended to by their medic. They were impressed by my ferocity but dismayed at my lack of control.  The clerics brought me into the fold and taught me that my strength could be put to righteous aims. They taught me to temper my fury and unleash it only when needed. In essence, they taught me how to live with myself.  After traveling with them for many years I decided to return to the town and seek out Arl and make amends if I could. I found him at the end of his life, desperately hoping to see me again so that he could apologize.  He told me that Anelia and Vinna hadn't died during the rebellion, though he hadn't heard from them since. Anelia had left and taken Vinna with her. She felt betrayed by my choice to fight instead of stay with her, and when Arl defended me, she took that as a sign that he valued business over family. He said that it was true, he didn't want to offend my father and lose their partnership. He didn't know that my father would leave the town as soon as he was able, with little regard for the business they had built together. When I returned, Arl was in financial ruin and lashed out at me, lying about Vinna and Anelia to hurt me.  I don't know where they are or if either of them are still alive, though Anelia would be quite elderly for a Halfling by now, but I intend to find them. If my daughter is alive, I plan on making up for all of the years I missed. If my wife is alive, I don't know how I'll react. I understand her frustration with me, but I have trouble with the idea of forgiving her for taking our daughter. For now the only goal is to find them, and do good on my path."}]}

She was the youngest of 6, and though she helped with the farm as they all did, her age and small size (she was particularly short and somewhat underweight as a child) excused her from some of the heavier work. Whenever that happened, or when her work was finished, she slipped away to go visit their neighbors’ horses, or the sheep that grazed over the hill past their lands, or to look for rabbits or toads or other critters by the creek behind the barn. Then, her magic started to trigger. The wheat grew taller where she walked, the garden she tended bore larger vegetables, though they turned sour when she was in a bad mood. Her father was thrilled. The Temple of the Blinding Light always welcomed more clerics to spread order in Pholtus’ name, which would not only mean one less daughter to feed, but would also increase his standing in the community, which held Pholtus and his temple in high esteem.  Her mother was not happy with this plan. Of the six, there were only two girls, and Lorrean’s older sister was already married. She finally agreed, however; after all, to serve Pholtus was a high honor, and the temple would undoutedly manage to teach the girl not to be so wild.  Lorrean overheard them come to their agreement, and was horrified. She did not like their visits to the temple, strict and quiet and perfectly clean. She did not like the clerics who kept the temple and scolded her for dirty feet and talking too much at all the wrong times and coming in with leaves in her hair. She did not want to leave home and her siblings--especially the youngest of her brothers, Dundrig, who played games with her when his work was done. But if she had to leave, she was certainly not going to serve Pholtus. She stowed away in the next trade wagon passing through, abandoned it by a river, and slowly wandered her way out of the farmlands and into the forests. In her loneliness, and desperate wishing for one of her brothers to be with her, her magic called up an animal companion, a badger she called Skur. Together, they found a badger set willing to take them in for awhile. The badgers called themselves the Hilldelver Set, so Lorrean became Meleskith Hilldelver. She and Skur learned to hunt and scavenge, and the badgers taught her to pull in her magic and bend it through leaf and root as a druid does--though animal magic is not like human magic, animals use it the way druids do. It was a rough education, but functional enough. She made contact with the other druids of the forest, the fire brigade. Having lived with badgers for a couple years by then, and having been a farmer before, she did not fit in. Then there was a small incident, a minor experiment with a fire spell--which did not go wild, whatever the supervisor might say to the contrary--and she decided that if they were going to lay down all these rules and try to control her, they were hardly better than Pholtus’ followers. When the Set decided it was time for her to move on--as all grown cubs must--she turned to the towns nearby, then to the cities. Since she had not fit in as a druid, she sought to make her way as a craftsperson, shaping wood and clay to useful things. But she bored quickly with useful things, and decided to try her hand at art instead.  It seemed like a good idea at the time. She tried very hard, and was very invested in her art--half-abstract things that felt like a thing’s magic more than looked like it’s shape, made of stone and wood bent and woven, or of a living plant growing through a stone shell. Her work did not catch on. Finally, after many years’ effort, she gave in, and accepted (a little bitterly) that her chosen path was not working out. She had been doing odd jobs to survive--repairs, seasonal farm work, digging cellars. Though she still used her druid magic, she never made her living by it. If she were more honest than usual, she might admit that she was afraid that her magic would be rejected as her art was, or that she was afraid her work elsewhere as a druid might backfire or blow up in her face as her stint in the fire brigade had (if not so literally).   While Meleskith struggled to find her place in the world, her place in the Temple of the Blinding Light, to which she had already been pledged before she made her escape, was filled by Dundrig Farrower. Though he had little magic himself, his farmer’s muscles turned well to wielding a hammer in battle. Once his training at the temple was complete, he was assigned to a pair of clerics, to help them carry Pholtus’ law to the unbelievers, to bring order to chaos, and to smite evil with the blinding light of Pholtus’ glory. If he is disappointed that he did not get to live out a quiet life at home, tending to his fields and raising a family of his own, he knows better than to let on to the zealots he works with."}]}

Thonrin was clan leader and Tena Master Brewer. Unbending as dwarves can be his mother had refused to leave her work up and to the day Thordren blessed the world, having been quoted saying, “Nor Battle, Nor Bairn, Nor Quake kenne keep me outta tha Brew”.  It was this clandestine birth that set young Thordren, unbeknownst to him at the time, toward his destiny and eventual fate. Uncommon to their dwarven kin the Silverheart family traveled frequently to trade and sell the infamous wares of their brewery.  Mostly under the protection of Tena and her staff, clan matters keeping Thonrin largely at home.  It was on these trips that Thordren became enamored with the wider world, and the cultures he met along the way. The Silverhearts had a reputation and Tena was primarily responsible.  Thordren would often accompany her on business deals and would sit and listen as his mother wove wild tales of Adventures and myths, legends and monsters and he would be there after the deals were “signed” to clean up the mess.  It was no surprise when Thordren asked to apprentice at his mother’s side, much to the dismay of his father.  Under his mother’s tutelage he developed a natural talent for brewing and became quite skilled in its consumption.  Thordren loved his time at the Brewery he felt at home among the masters and understood almost innately how each ingredient influenced and enhanced the spirits and brews that were famous to the Silverstout.  This complex understanding lent its way into Thordrens second love, the way of the song.  Amongst the vats of boiling liquids and within the bars and taverns he visited as he grew up, he came to learn that with beer came song and with song came pure joy.  It didn’t take too long for his mother to notice that on business dealings in which Thordren accompanied her contracts and profits doubled.  It was on one of these trips, dealing with a nearby elvish settlement that Thordrens voice caught the eye of the local Lord and won him acceptance into a prestigious elven Bardic College.  At the adolescent age of 45 Thordren embarked on his first adventure away from his family and Kin. College among the elves was strange at first.  Being a dwarf amidst elves left him isolated and often cast out from social gatherings, but he quickly overcame the adversity and soon his wit charm and skill had him accepted with the elvish community.  Thordren lived with laughter in his heart and he excelled in his schooling there wasn’t and instrument he couldn’t play, and song he couldn’t sing, a tale he couldn’t weave and an elf he couldn’t outdrink.  It was during his fourth year that he met Maethil’wyn Talanmyr.   Maethil’wyn was an elven girl of high standing and a bardic student at the college her and Thordren attended.  Thordren was smitten almost instantly, his history and experiences of traveling with his parents had chipped away at the natural mistrusting nature of dwarfs, and he found Mae fascinating.  Mae was nothing but trouble in her own right as her tendency for mischief and almost instance acceptance of other races set her in opposition of the natural xenophobia of her elven counterparts.  They met during a heated drinking competition, which Thordren had started with his big mouth.  It would end horribly for him the minute Mae entered.  (I imagine the Marion drinking scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark).  From that moment on the two became an inseparable pair of trouble and mayhem. (Thordren never confessed his feelings for Mae but remained infatuated) Once graduated the two decided to be a duo of sorts and traveled all around the country side as a Bardic duo, Mae often using mainly her voice and Thordren providing the musical background.  They became quote renowned for their performances as well as the wake they left in town, taverns and bars. They had earned enough renown over two years that they drew the attention of a Prominent Elven Lord that they were invited to stay on as employed performers for the court.  Mae took a keen interest in this contract while Thordren was iffy.  During their year of employment Mae grew increasingly less interested in mischief and rambunctious behavior.  (I like to think the Elves have a sort of Rumspringa for the youth to experience some things outside of elven culture but to return to the fold.  Thordren has a limited understanding of this and feels that he can sway her, and Mae assumes he has understood her explanations.) Eventually tensions between the two grew as Mae became more and more interested in the affairs of the court than the performing and rowdy nightlife.  On the day that Mae was considered an adult her father came to announce that she was to be betrothed to the son of the Lord. Thordren was beside himself with anger frustration and confusion.  He engaged Mae in a heavy argument about their relationship and his understanding of things as she relayed with cool elven diplomacy the true nature of who they were, duty bound her to her family and her time for fun was at an end.  Thordren stormed out, resigning his position and drowned his sorrows in the local tavern, his whole world having been shattered. The events of that night are not very clear to Thordren.  He had never really felt anger before, his whole life and been surrounded by people who were generally happy, intoxicated or a lovely mixture of both.  His parents were merry folk and the patrons of Silverstout brewery were mostly equally as merry.  Having the nature tendencies for bardic optimism it had never even occurred that he and Mae might end or that his story might end in misery.  He had spent his first 50 years of life thinking he was the hero of his story and that there would be nothing but happy endings.  Too far into the drink to realize the consequences of his action Thordren set his mind to getting back his happy ending. Storming into the Lords mansion Thordren set to finding the young Lords son, who in his eyes was the sole person responsible for the loss of Mae and Thordren’s current predicament.  Upon finding him in the mansion gardens sitting with Mae, Thordren lost what little sense he had left.  Remembering a spell he learned about he attempted to Dominate the mind of Mae’s betrothed, to great misfortune.  The spell being beyond the ability of Thordren himself but fueled by his anger managed to connect, instantly the dwarf became aware of the thoughts and feeling of the elf, in his rage Thordren will him to forget all about Mae, to leave them alone and never bother them again.  His control of the spell was weak and Mae’s attempted dispel created a magical backlash sending the dwarf and elf into unconsciousness. When Thordren awoke he was in his home among the Hill dwarfs, sober and foggy as to how he got there.  He would later learn about his attempts at mind control and the assault of the Lords son. The Elf had suffered severely and was still in a coma, but hopes were high that mages would eventually set him right.  The elven lord had advocated death for Thordren’s assault but he was returned to dwarven land to face dwarven justice.  To save the reputation of his clan a deal was made that Thordren would be banished from his homeland never again able to return.  And so it was that at the age of 52 Thordren was ejected from his family and his people. For 23 years Thordren wandered the lands, playing for taverns and keeps, lords and villagers. He kept his shame a secret and hid his pain with loud laughter and raucous behavior.  He swore again to never act out in anger and to remain true to his upbringing.  His only therapy and redemption for the heartache he caused his family and clan was his ability to bring happiness and joy to those who would listen to his songs and laugh at his performances.  During the early years of his exile Thordren’s penchant for trouble earned him a nemesis in another traveling bard/thief, the two often encountered each other along the road and would wither end in brawls or gambling losses.  In one of these battles Thordren lost a lute, given to him my Mae, in a bet in which his nemesis cheated.  He is bound and determined to get it back from him the next time he finds him. Meeting Aldric Stormcrow Near his 65th nameday (Early-thirties for a dwarf) Thordren was participating in a rather intense contest of wills with the Tavern Owner when he overheard a patron mentioning having spotted a group of Flumphs in a cave outside of town.  This piqued Thordren’s interest.  Flumphs, normally reserved to living in the Underdark had always intrigued Thordren.  The only nice and relatively peaceful thing to come from the bowels of the Underdark Flumphs were truly ridiculous to behold.  Many a tale of the wonders of “Flumph Flipping” had been told to him by his uncle and Thordren had always wanted to experience this wonder for himself.  Excited by the opportunity Thordren quickly left the tavern to find the Flumphs.  Wandering drunkenly into the cavern Thordren found the Flumphs in a very agitated state, and proceeded to agitate them further.  In a drunken stupor Thordren began to wildly flip the Flumphs over, this being easy to do as Flumphs float on jets of air that they suck in through their mouths and expend through their tentacles. His joy was heightened by finding out that make a sort of slide whistle sound as they flip.  Careless of the repercussions of his actions Thordren quickly learned that while mostly peaceful Flumphs still have some defenses.  One Flumphs stink spray is enough to nearly incapacitate a normal person, and that night Thordren was hit by no less than 8.  Completely drunk and delirious from the smell Thordren discovered the reason for the Flumphs abnormal existence above the Underdark.  Thordren awoke a little more sober and a lot more stinky to being tied up and in the company of two trolls 6 goblins and a Bugbear, who had been happily hunting Flumphs and stumbled across him.  Aldric Stormcrow had been traveling in the area on contract to kill the Bugbear leader when the smell of the dwarf had caught his attention.  Once freed and enemies killed Thordren pledged himself to Aldrics side in offer of repayment.Much to Aldrics dismay this would not be the last time he had to bail Thordren out of a deadly incident. What was supposed to be a yearlong pledge ended up turning into a 10 year friendship of adventure?   Facts Thordren Keeps Secret: Only Aldric knows the shame of his banishment in any detail. Thordren keeps a lock of Mae’s hair, a gift given to him in friendship on graduation. Thordren says his Clan name was Silverheart but it is really Silverstout he changed it to keep from further shaming his clan and their product. Thordren keep his emotions in an almost dangerous check.  He never seems to let his anger out, being afraid of how things will turn out.  He hides it all with a jovial positive upbeat attitude.  No one knows the true pain and shame he feels. Thordren does not know what happened to Mae and her betrothed, as he avoids the areas near his homeland. Thordren has twin younger brothers both Clerics and a younger sister who is a monk. Silverstout brewery survived the scandal and is still a popular brewery.  Thordren is melancholy when it is available in an establishment and always orders two pints and drinks only one leaving the other full and untouched   shortly after bardic college maewin and I decide to travel a bit. Shes tired of living the stuff life of a daughter to a popular Lord and Trad merchant family.So since I grew up traveling with my family selling our beer and spirits I show her the open road we run into this half drow bard charlatan as he his failing a Con hes trying to run we take him in and help him clear his name, and we convince him to hang with us we have a great time for a couple of years, but hes been running cons for a long time and it is eventually catching up with him He is also falling for Maewin, but her and I are falling for each other eventually we decide this life is too good to pass up and decide to elope, right around the time his dark past catches up with him.  In his jealous and desperation to contacts maewins family and runs his con he manages to clear his past, and Maewins family comes to find her and marry her off for political gain.  She feels honorbound to her family and agrees. In my heartbreak I attack Dario and we fight a bit, I manged to ruin his con and he is sent to prison, I then turn my rage on Maewins betrothed and put him in a coma Her Trade Merchant Family threatens the ruination of the SilverStout name I am exiled and cut from my family in a deal to keep the 800 year old brewery and family name intact  I wander aimlessly for a few years before running into him again a few times. he jumps me one day and steals the lute that I had been given by my family with maewins token on it  "}]}

He was born in a small elf village to parents in the middle of the power hierarchy. By a strange coincidence upon Aelar's 25th birthday, a wizard who had previously resided in the village, Adorellan Xyrphine, returned and asked for an apprentice to assist him at his tower. Many elvish parents offered their children to him, but he choose Aelar because he \"looked bored.\" After returning to the tower, fresh apprentice in tow, Adorellan began teaching Aelar the art of the arcane. Seven years later, after a lecture was interrupted by the sudden heaving of bloody vomit, Adorellan revealed he was dying of a mysterious curse he received while researching his life's work, the creatures of the lower planes. The curse was resistant all the forms of removal attempted; the most that could be done was slow its progress. As it continued to ravage his body Adorellan concocted a plan: acquire an apprentice, train them all he could in his limited time, reveal his plight, and then seal himself himself away with an “Imprison” spell, locked away by a phrase only his apprentice would know, until the time came that the curse was identified and a cure found. With the parting words of “continue my research” the wizard removed himself from the flow of time until the fated day that Aelar succeeds in his quest. After 140 years of traveling to countless libraries and obtaining any and all information relating to this curse and more generally the lower planes, Aelar realized the easiest way to learn more of them was to encounter the creatures of it in person.

Like lost Shangri-La (from The Lost Horizon), or forgotten Gondolin (from The Silmarillion), it is here the Snow Elves make their way isolated from the world around them. And from this land comes forth Bethshaia Katiyn D’Hiveryn (or “Shay”) on a quest to save her people from certain doom.  The youngest daughter of the great Elven House of Katiyn, her mother is a grande-dame of Hiveryn society, and her father a great military hero of the city. Though estranged from her mother, Shay is the apple of her father’s eye.

He took  quickly to history and became proficient in the times of past. He trained  under numerous tutors of war from lands near and far he quickly became a  prodigy of battle, he picked up the spear and short sword and soon there  were no more tutors to best and fighting became what hewas was known for.

She never learned which lady was her mother, but was raised communally by all the women. By the age of fourteen she had decided that she did not want their kind of life for herself, and ran away to live on the streets. It only took one night of carelessness for her to lose what few possessions she had brought from the brothel, and she found herself scrounging refuse heaps just to survive. As a result, she learned to sleep with all she owns wrapped in a bundle in her arms.  After several weeks of living in alleyways and fighting other vagrants for scraps of food, Lysariel was discovered, gaunt and shivering, outside of The Stag at Bay by Thalon Elendiir. Taking pity on the younger girl, he brought her back to the rooftop hideout of a small group of guttersnipes. Thalon and the other children took turns teaching Lysariel the “code” of the streets, which mainly consisted of who to respect, who to avoid, and when to look the other way. She also learned of hidden ways through the urban sprawl of Everlund, how to secretly pocket items when no one was looking, and (perhaps the most important) how to make a quick escape. Lysariel adapted easily to the group’s guidelines, and always shared her finds of food and copper with them as a way of showing her gratitude.  Ten years later, Lysariel found herself in the garrison headquarters for the Army of the Vale. Exposure to the elements, severe poverty, and enduring illness had driven her to desperation and she yearned to find a better life. At the age of twenty-four she was physically mature for an elf, but was otherwise still considered a child, and it took a good deal of persuasion (and quite a few lies) to convince the recruitment officer to allow her to sign up for the army. She was placed as a scout beneath the leadership of Adran Veladorn, a cleric of Torm.  Though Adran was less strict than most followers of Torm, working with him came as something of a shock to Lysariel after living so long on the street. In addition to reading and writing, formal military training, tactical maneuvers, and field medicine were practices she had never considered she would learn. Adran also tried to discourage her from some of her less honest habits, though when pressed he admitted such skills did came in handy for scouts. She was careful to hide her own religious beliefs from him, however, as she doubted her occasional donations to the Church of Mask would be taken lightly.  After five years of routine patrols along the Everlund to Sundabar trail escorting merchant trade caravans, the duo was dispatched as agents of the Army of the Vale to the town of Westerville. Adran’s commanding officer had heard rumors of problems with the newly discovered silver mines, and wanted the two to follow up. When Adran decided to return to Everlund after issues with the locals, Lysariel took advantage of his departure to send her resignation of commission back with him. Becoming an adventurer sounded much less restrictive… and more lucrative, to boot."}]}

Having four elder siblings Keras was unlikely to inherit so he was promised at the young age of 75 to the local chapter of the Order of the Golden Lion in Alaghôn, the capital city of Turmish. Until that point, Keras had been the definition of rich idleness, content to lounge in the family manor and spend his night cavorting and gambling amongst others of his station. Once inducted as a Paladin of Torm, however... he remained much the same, the addition of a few hours spent training to appease his family.  Several decades passed in this way, with only the changing fashions favored by the young wastrel marking the passage of time before something spurred him into action. Word passed through the Order's barracks (which were frequented by Keras only on the rare days he tired of the gambling house) that one of the senior administrators of the chapter would be retiring in the coming weeks. Believing himself a shoo-in, due to his family's many contributions to the Order, both as members and as patrons over the centuries, Keras met with the head of Alaghôn's chapter and went on at length on his devotion to the tenets of the Order and his desire to do more, all without mentioning his interest in the position explicitly, trusting in the man to read between the lines and offer him the cushy desk job, and the prestige that came with it, on the spot.  Reading between the lines, however, is not exactly a tenet espoused by Torm's paladins, and the head paladin, so moved by Keras' passionate words, proclaimed the young elf to be the very model of a paladin and that his talents were being wasted in Alaghôn. Before Keras could get a word in edgewise the elder paladin ordered him to pack his bags and set out into the world, to fight injustice and be a beacon in the name of Torm for the world to see.  Keras tried in vain to reverse this decision, pleading with his mother to write to the head paladin, but his cries fell on deaf ears. Naireema, tiring of her son's incessant idleness, agreed with the head paladin's decision, if not his reasoning. Going out into the world and adventuring as his forefathers would be good for him, she proclaimed, and so she handed over the holy symbol carried by the first member of their house to join the Order and bundled him out of their manor so fast that he barely had an opportunity to say farewell to his sisters. With a final, genuine plea from his mother to bring honor to his family, Keras was cast out of his family home and into the metaphorical, and eventually literal, wilds.  Keras has been on the road for just under a year at this point and is still naive about much of the world. He knows a surprising amount about trade thanks to his family's connections, but in terms of 'useful' knowledge, he is wholly unprepared. As well, he is unused to encountering poverty in his daily life and is incredibly uncomfortable with it. He has a bit of a gambling addiction but is smart enough to recognize it and tries to curb those impulses most, but not all, of the time."}]}

Along with his three siblings, Rhoana, Ciara, and Tián; Rhydian grew up at his father's ancestral home and the seat of power within House Ty 'aer, Caer Hen, a small castle located on the outskirts of Valander. Rhydian's father is a respected and noble born political figure within elven society, his mother Rheala, however, was of lower birth, a fact that did not sit well with many of his father's friends and family. Though due to Tegerin's status as lord of the house, no one dared question his choice of marriage to his face. Though Tegerin is a hard man and staunch supporter of traditionalist elven views, Rheala was much more of a free spirit. Few are sure what drew the two together, but many would agree that they drew out the best in one another and Tegerin was certainly more pleasant when in her company. From a young age Rhydian was trained how to fight properly. His mother was a notably skilled marksman and hunter, though she wouldn't talk about it, Rhydian always suspected she had some history in the military. Though in what capacity he had no idea. When Rhydian was nineteen his mother took him and his younger brother Tián, who was only twelve at the time, on a hunt in the Whitewoods. This was to be Tián's first hunt and a quick excursion before the start of the day's major events. The hunt was a success with Rhydian taking down two deer with one arrow each. This would have been one of the proudest moments of Rhydian's life had it not been for the arrival of a band of marauders knows as the Free Wolves who ambushed them on their return to Valander. The Free Wolves caught Rheala, Rhydian, and Tián off-guard and in an attempt to capture Rheala alive as a hostage for ransom a fight ensued. At his mother's command Rhydian attempted to flee with Tián to safety, unfortunately they were perused and cut off. Though Rhydian escaped with his life, Rheala and Tián perished. A memory that haunts Rhydian to this day. Many would say that following Rheala's death any noticeable joy or kindness in Tegerin abruptly vanished. In his grief he placed much of the blame on Rhydian, which created a great rift in their relationship. Tegerin also became much more driven in his work. In the years following, his relationship with his two children Ciara and Rhydian rapidly eroded. One year after the murder of his mother and younger brother, Rhydian decided that it was finally time to leave his life in Valandar behind and see the rest of the world. Ciara decided to leave with him, and much to the disapproval of their father they set off. In doing so Tegerin disowned them both. Rhydian and Ciara traveled North, eventually settling in the major port city of Nevish. For many decades the twins worked together performing odd jobs that required a more subtle approach. One day Ciara accepted a small job offer from a local crime boss by the name of Johan Wiese. The just was simple, pick up the goods from the provider and drop them off for Wiese's men. Unfortunately, something went wrong and Ciara was killed in a scuffle with one of Wiese's lieutenants Lucian de Vond. Since then Rhydian his left behind his dangerous life and taken up a simple life as a performer at a local tavern. Rhydian wears his sister's sword \"Tangwyn\" always as a reminder. "}]}

Daefir's child name was Naelar BrightWater. Daefir took his adult name at the spry young age of 80, when he led his first hunting party. Daefir was raised in the Wise Woods, and was brought up learning the ways of the healer, helping his mother Zylralei heal any wounded members of the clan. As well as learning to heal others, Daefir learned the ways of nature, and how important nature is to all life on the planet. 8 years after taking his adult name, Daefir was on a hunting mission by himself, wandering the Wise Woods tracking what seemed to be a herd of some beasts. Daefir followed the tracks to find a sight that horrified him: a clearing had been chopped into the woods, the mangled corpses of the trees tossed aside carelessly and unceremoniously. Scared and distraught, Daefir searched the clearing for any sign of what could have done this to his woods. Amongst some broken branches and some ashes, he found a small knife. Though it was nothing special, there was something off about this knife. Daefir was used to the elegant blades of the elves, but this knife was exactly the opposite: rough, blunt, and cruel - looking. He recalled a story his father had once told him that included blades very similar to the style of this blade. After some thought and pondering, he realized what he had found: the knife of an orc. Panicked, Daefir searched the clearing and quickly found the trail the orcs left as they deserted their camp. They were headed east, straight for the home of Daefir's clan. Daefir ran as fast as he could, tracking the scar the orcs had left across the forest, trying to catch up to them or beat them to his home. He had to warn his family, his friends, and his clan. Daefir ran for 25 miles, as fast as he could back to his home. Upon arrival, all that remained of his clans home were the signs of a battle: Bodies strewn across the forest floor; a few low burning flames; the stench of blood; and lastly, two lone, young lootahs. A rage swept over Daefir as he nocked an arrow and sent it through the heart of the first orc. Before the dead orc had even hit the ground Daefir was charging into the second orc with his blade drawn. A short fight burst out, the orc and the elf attacking with merciless fury. After a few seconds, the orc joined his friend upon the forest floor, dead. Daefir searched his clans home and found his parents, his friends, and every single one of his clan members dead, slain by the orc tribes cruel blades and maces. The elf wept, for a day and a night. Once he could weep no more, Daefir gathered the bodies of his clansmen, gave them an elvish funeral, buried the bodies in 8 large graves, one grave for every family of the clan, and returned them to nature. He then went to the orc bodies left strewn about, and cast them into the forest. From each orc body left behind by their brethren, Daefir took a single tooth. He strung these teeth together to keep as a necklace, and as a reminder of what the orcs have done to his family and to him. Daefir, covered in blood, dirt, sweat and tears, went to a nearby stream to clean himself. At the stream, he met a wizard. The human went by the name of (Daniel's Character), and he was kind to Daefir. The elf and the human became fast friends, and together they left the place that had been forever tainted for Daefir. They traveled north to the city of (whatever the city called lol) in search of knowledge and to bring forth what Daefir had learned: orcs are cruel and evil beings that must not be trusted. "}]}

The Von Rylann’s were merchant nobles, purchasing the family title over six-hundred years ago with the vast wealth they had accumulated through their ruthless trading empire. The empire was built over a period of 350 years by Thrennilsif, X’enthaladae’s great-grandmother, before grooming her eldest son, Heraltheon to take over and expand the empire. Heraltheon turned out to be as ruthless as his mother and garnered several monopolies on commodities as well as exclusive rights to many of the most profitable trading routes. Heraltheon built on his mother’s efforts, expanding the family’s wealth to be able to purchase their noble title, hoping to solidify the position of the family among the aristocracy and allow their business to profit from noble law. It was at the height of the Von Rylann merchant empire when Heraltheon passed the mantle of house Patriarch to Baelleron. Baellerion was one of six siblings, and the second son of Heraltheon. The eldest son, Galistriaan, was passed over for Patriarch because Heraltheon thought him weak. Baelleron did not share his father’s view of his eldest brother seeing in him a very keen mind for business. In an attempt to mend the rift between Baelleron and his five siblings placed each as head of different trade routes for the vast empire, with Galistriaan appointed to the most profitable of all routes. This kindness was ultimately Baelleron’s undoing.  With Baelleron relying on each of his siblings to manage their own part of the empire, he no longer had direct information about the day-to-day business. This hands-off approach allowed Galistriaan to manipulate his siblings over the years, consolidate the business holdings and was able to establish a rival company that now held all of the Von Rylann previously owned assets which Galistriaan now held sole ownership of. This left Baelleron and Meredith along with their three children bankrupt.  X’enthaladae was blissfully unaware of any of the machinations by his uncle. Having two older siblings, a brother Mordellath and sister Daesthena, the Von Rylann family had it’s heirs. Both of X’enthaladae’s siblings were being groomed for the family business, and more power to them. Business was not something X’enthaladae thought interesting in the least. And being the youngest of three children, X’enthaladae was left to pursue his life of idleness and wonton spending of the family’s fortune. He would pursue one pastime or another, wherever his fancy would lead, which often lead him to women and drink. But, he eventually discovered a talent for the Arcane and was a very good student when he could be bothered to try.  The morning that his family was officially bankrupt started out quite normally for X’enthaladae, that is to say hung-over and in the company of a young lady whose name he couldn’t recall. He didn’t believe it when his sister told him, he didn’t believe it when his brother told him, he didn’t even believe it when his mother and father told him. It wasn’t until he was forcefully removed by several heavily armed and armored men that it started sinking in that they might not have anymore money.  With no skills and no money X’enthaladae was left to fend for himself. While his family was willing to put up with his antics when their resources were near infinite, with nothing but their purchased title to their names, he was quickly turned out to make his own way in the world. Each of his family members had a lifetime of dedication and skills which they quickly sought to leverage toward gaining back their wealth, each as their personal skills dictated. His Mother and Father, scraped together some funds to purchase a cargo vessel and put their sea fairing skills to use following in Baelleron’s grandmother’s footsteps. His Brother had married into another Noble family before the fall, and was forced to leverage his wife’s fortune toward rebuilding his own. His sister had much of Uncle Galistriaan’s abilities and after the fall took advantage of all the less than reputable business contacts she had made over the years to apply her skills within the ranks of the underworld. Which left X’enthaladae alone in a world that doesn’t care if you are a noble if you do not have money. For months he spent time staying with any of his friends that would have him, but there too he soon wore out his welcome. With no one left to sponge off of, X’enthaladae was forced to do the worst thing he could imagine. Get a job.  That is how X’enthaladae found himself walking down this road after successfully escorting a caravan to Keskit…"}]}

The monks that raised me suggested that I do this.  I personally don’t know how much it will benefit me, but it certainly can’t hurt.  I guess I should start at the first memories I have.  I remember mass confusion, fire, fighting and destruction.  There were men on horseback that were killing everyone.  I’ll never forget the sight of one of them riding up behind my mother and hauling her up and over his saddle.  He knocked her in the head with his sword to quiet her screams and struggles.  I was hiding in the old basement of the village church where my mother had stashed me for safety with the instructions ”Don’t come out no matter what happens.  They must not find you or find out about you for the safety of all of us.  Promise me you will stay hidden until one comes that your heart tells you you can trust.  Until then you must stay alive and hidden, there is food stashed here for you for a week.”  I stayed where I was and watched the rest of my village die.  They lit the church on fire when they burned the rest of the village to the ground.  The church was made of stone so only the wooden pews burned.  I watched and I prayed.  Prayed to every god that would listen,  for understanding and knowledge and most of all for justice for all of the villagers cut down w/o a chance.   They fed the fires for 2 days, even then I recognized the mark and stench of magical fire.  The only one I saw them carry away was my mother,  they may have taken others as slaves or sacrifices, I’m not sure.  The feeling of evil radiated off of them like rays from the sun.  They raked threw the ashes to make sure everything was burned.  They were not interested in plunder at all, only utter destruction.  When they left the fires were but smoke and rubble.  There was a pall of despair in their wake.  It seemed like the sun had to filter thru a cover of ugliness even at high noon.  Carrion eaters wouldn’t even descend, not that there was anything left for them.  Still I prayed.  I could do nothing else.  I guess I received an answer as I knew that if I betrayed my presence to them it would all have been in vain.  So I waited and watched.  2 days after the village was burned a small party of clerics that had dark robes came by.  They appeared to be looking for something.  I sincerely hoped they wouldn’t find me.  While they were there it seemed as if the cloud thickened and grew more evil.  They searched all day and night.  As dawn approached they finally passed on.   3 days after the clerics left I felt a change.  I could actually feel the sun again, and see the gloom lifting.  A man walked to where I was hiding and he seemed to know I was there.  He just stood nearby and said. ”There will come a day when you know that you must trust your heart as your mother told you, is today that day?”  Then he stood there and waited, I somehow knew he could wait forever w/o any problems.  I listened to my heart that day when I came out of my hiding place and began to follow the monk.  We traveled far.  We stopped at several different monasteries, but only to pray and rest.  In between he taught me the ways and thoughts of a monk.  He taught me to always find balance within myself as well as the world we passed thru.  Finally we came to a small monastery that I never would have even seen with out his help.  It was literally part of a mountain and the monastery was within the mountain itself.  It reminded me of a dwarven city that I had heard my mother telling stories about.  The monk just walked up to a tree, knocked on it and said,  ” We of the Brotherhood have passed our test and request entrance the Monastery of Learning.”  Then another voice said ”What tests have you passed that has earned your entrance to this holy place?”  ”We have traveled far and followed the way of our hearts within thru fire, darkness, despair and temptation to come together to this place.” said my friend.  ”If what you say is true, you will find your own entrance and pass thru w/o harm, if you fail you will never remember this place as only the ones who truly follow the inner path may pass the barrier intact,”  the bodiless voice returned.  My friend nodded, took my hand and we walked thru the solid mountain.     "}]}

He often ran to the solitude of the forests exploring the trees and hunting and studying the wildlife, while training with a long bow he stole from the guards, far too large for him. He was however, not a very good student and had no real friends, he preferred the solitude that the forest and mountains afforded him. When news of the Last War reached Aerenal, human’s searching for any warriors to fight for their kings. Raloren being only in his 20’s was considered not old enough to fight. However, he snuck on to one of the Brelish boats if at least to get away from Aeranel. A mercenary by the name Erlan found him stowed away in the cargo hold hungry and regretful of his decision. Instead of exposing Raloren to the ship’s captain, he brought him food and took him under his wing. After arriving in Breland, Erlan brought Raloren to his mercenary company and ask them to accept him into their ranks having seen potential in him. Erlan taught Raloren the way of the sword. Raloren proved a quick study but still preferring the bow to the sword. After 20 years of training with Erlan, Raloren was finally ready to fight and so he did. For the next 70+ years Raloren worked his way up the ranks of his mercenary company, as well as bringing up the station of his company within the Brelish army. He fought many battles and worked with many interesting characters, notably a changeling spy named Tazzak, whose odd demeanor made Raloren question whether he could trust him, but ultimately his raw killing ability made Raloren admire Tazzaks efficiency. As well as bonding with a war horse he named Charger whom he nursed back to health using the knowledge he gained back in the forests of Aeranel. He was a prodigal fighter finding very little match for his prowess with both blade and bow for nearly 70 years. Until one battle, defending the Lurching tower near the Cyre, Breland, and Thrane joint border.  During the battle, Raloren saw an enormous man, riding an enormous horse, and shot him off his horse with the same bow that he stole from the guards so long ago. The man was much quicker than Raloren could expect from a man that imposing. He was quickly upon Raloren and slashed apart that bow he has been training with for his entire life, the only thing he had left from Aeranel. With no time to mourn for his prized possession, Raloren pulled out his blades and tried his best to fight back against the man he figured based on the crest on his armor and stories from the front was probably the Hell Hound of the famed Devil Dogs. Raloren moved quick to avoid the Hell Hounds sweeping strikes and parrying when he could. Baited into an opening, Raloren lunged at his opponent who grabbed and shattered his blade at the handle, then kicked to the ground. Without breath and desperate to survive, another Brelish soldier Raloren did not know distracted the Hell Hound with a slash to his back, to which he responded by cutting the man in two. Raloren horrified by what he just saw, attacked at the opening and cut the Hell Hound up the left side of his face. In that moment, the hulking man swung the flat side of his blade right into Raloren’s breaking it, the two stared at one another with hatred and respect for a moment before Erlan had called for Raloren to retreat, the cyre soldiers had flanked their forces and the battle was lost. After the war, Raloren was unsure whether to return to Aeranel, a place which he never considered a home, or staying in Breland to continue on as a mercenary. Instead, Raloren and Erlan became part of the fledgling nation of Valenar creating of one of the lesser war-clans, the wolf clan, with other members of their mercenary group. Amongst a raid from a war-clan of a much higher status trying to absorb his own Raloren was rushed into the battle killing his fair share of combatants. He noticed Erlan fighting a Dalan Rael, a holy warrior committed to dying like his ancestors. Erlan, who also became a Dalan Rael, submitted to his righteous death at the hands of a greater warrior. Raloren fataly shot the Dalan Rael right before the invader could kill his mentor. After the battle the tribe leader, his old mercenary general whom Raloren shared no love for, Commander Elladar, consulted with the Keeper of the Past to determine what his punishment for dishonoring the ancestors, by saving Erlan from righteous death. Erlan joined the discussions and upon finding that they were planning on punishing Raloren by death, offered the keepers his life in service in exchange for Raloren being exiled. The keepers agreed, but Elladar, seeing both Erlan and Raloren as threats to his leadership, executed Erlan when they returned to the village. Raloren was exiled from all lands of Valenar, Charger was too old to come with him so he was left behind. Raloren was allowed to leave unharmed under the condition that he never returns or he will face death. However, Raloren has dedicated the past 3 years to training so that he can kill his commander Elladar thus allowing him to return as leader of his war tribe.  Raloren, for the third time in his life felt like he had no home, returned to Breland. Unable to find anywhere he felt he belonged, Raloren returned to the forests. He lived his days out hunting and subsisting in the King’s Forest. Finding a new companion in the form of a dire wolf pup he named Flip, because every time he approached him the wolf would flip over to have its belly rubbed. He lived in the forest just him and Flip for nearly a year until his path crossed a Hound Archon named Bolt, who saw his skill and invited him to join his crew as a protector of his sailors."}]}

His father, Loegaire, was a wealthy merchant, his mother Silvren the ranger daughter of a Lord. They lived in a large house on a hill, overlooking the city of Oestramoor in the country of Tamaris. There was plenty of space for he and his sister to run free and play, and they often spent their time in the surrounding Marrowood, running through the black and silver trees.  But around the time he was fifty, his sister began to show signs of arcane ability. Strong, frightening ability. She would practice in solitude, often hiding from her younger brother, although he was fascinated by her skill. He was too young to understand that their father would see this as a problem.  When she came of age and chose the name Aoibheann, she approached their father asking to enter the arcane school of the Spire. Rinn was not there to witness the fight, but it escalated quickly, her father refusing to let her go for fear it would draw negative attention to their family, as magical abilities were frowned upon in Tamaris. Aoibheann's abilities were too dangerous, he insisted, and she countered that she needed to attend in order to learn to control it. When he told her no such thing would happen, she unleashed a spell by accident in her fury, nearly hitting her father. Enraged, he cast her out.  Horrified by the events, Rinn took off into the night after his sister, subsequently getting lost and separated from his parents. He wandered alone for some time, and when autumn rolled in he happened upon a band of gnomish vagabonds in the woods, singing and drinking around a campfire. Hungry, he approached them, and to his surprise they sat him right down and fed him. He ended up staying on.  The gnomes were a group of tricksters who made their silver by swindling people in small towns, staying just long enough to finish their 'job' before leaving quickly the next morning before anyone was any bit the wiser. Although dishonest, they were not cruel, and they taught him the value of mirth and a cheerful disposition. He learned many tricks himself, things that would help him along his path later on.   He also learned the thieves' cant from them, a language spoken in front of those they were targeting, that only they could understand. The young elf became invaluable to them. He was just as charming and cunning as they were, and soon he was helping them pull off larger swindles than they could have managed on their own. It was here he gained his facial piercings, as the same adorned many of the gnomes.  He was invaluable until they needed money.  One evening when he was 115, the elf boy was lead away after dinner with the gnomes by the elder, through the woods until they came upon a road. Down a short way, there was a caravan of brightly coloured wagons, on the side of which read \"Green Port Circus.\" As they drew nearer, he heard the roars and growls of animals, kept chained behind the wagons. A lion, a bear, a direwolf. He would later learn they were part of the act.  A human in a red and blue striped coat approached them, and handed the gnome a small purse of gold. \"Sorry, boy,\" the gnome told him, \"it's only business.\"  Before he could realize what was happening, he was being herded into a wagon.  When his eyes adjusted to the light, he saw himself among six others: a dwarf, two female human twins, a gnome with gems encrusted in his teeth, and another elf, who sat clutching a small baby wrapped in a swaddle.  At first he begrudged the gnomes for giving him over to the circus troupe, but having nowhere else to go, he stayed on, becoming skilled in acrobatics. He performed all sorts of feats on the high wire, the trapeeze. And over time, he became friends with the troupe themselves.  There was the dwarf, called Hamhock, who had amazing strength. The human twins, who did beautiful dance routines, Myra and Lyra. The gnome, Raspip, who did wonderful magic tricks. And then there was the animal tamer, a beautiful high elf with indigo blue tattoos named Caoimhe. Perhaps it was their shared history, but they became fast friends, Caoimhe eventually teaching him to care for the Bear, which lead to his nickname of Mahon, given affectionately by his friend.  Caoimhe's son was a half-drow named Oisin, and his birth was something Caoimhe only called \"a short and unpleasant story.\" He had the pale skin of his mother, but rather than share her blonde hair, his was a shocking white, and his eyes red. Though many would view him as abhorrent in the elven community, Mahon said he was only a baby.  Mahon and Caoimhe spent most of their time together, developing a dual act involving the lion and the bear. Mahon became so attached to the bear that one evening Caoimhe jokingly offered him a tattoo of a bear. To her surprise, Mahon agreed, and she teased him by saying she would put it on his face. He only shrugged, and so they spent hours in the firelight as she carefully pricked his cheek again and again, until a dark blue bear bloomed there on his face. He couldn't mind, seeing as she was the one who gave him the name he decided to keep, Mahon, \"bear.\"  Life in the circus was so grand that Mahon let the thoughts of his family, and his original quest to find his sister, slip entirely. The only problem was the ringleader, Sebastian, who had originally purchased Mahon's services. He was prone to drink, and would become mean. And then one night he threatened Caoimhe's young son, calling him an \"abomination.\" He was repentant in the morning, but to the dismay of all, Caoimhe and her son had fled in the night, leaving not even a note for Mahon.  Mahon, realizing he had been in love, was heartbroken.   In retribution, he left the following evening, after freeing all the animals in the night. The bear, confused, had tried to follow him. Despite Mahon's attempt to shoo it, Bear came with him, and the two wandered the countryside searching for Caoimhe and Oisin.  Eventually they came to Vas Nuar, and he gave up on his search, settling in a house outside the city and spending his time honing his craft. Although many bad things had happened in his short life, Mahon, now 270, seemed content to carry on exactly as he was. He was happy, busy, he figured he had everything he wanted. He had learned long ago to not dwell on the past and what he no longer had.  He is no longer searching for Aoibheann or Caoimhe, and has no idea what happened to his family, but you would never know it from his happy-go-lucky demeanor. He's just not one to pine."}]}

My story  is one of  bizarre coincidences to be sure.  First off my family’s legacy of a magical bow is mine without any instructions.  I know my elven relatives are quite affronted by my  mother’s temerity in naming me as the bearer of the bow.  I know that it has a long and involved history, even if I don’t know what that is.   It is a family heirloom.  The one obvious thing that it does is magically create it’s own arrows.  I know it glows sometimes but I haven’t decided if it glows around danger or evil, to me or it.  My teacher I think knows more but chooses not to tell me for promises to my parents who were great friends of hers.  I know that she decided to take me on out of friendship for them and I think, regret that she was not there to help when they needed it most.  My parents were well known as hero’s and adventurers even while they were shunned for being together and even more after I was born.  They didn’t care what their families and friends thought, they belonged together and that was that.  The 2 of them together were a sight to see, you could easily visualize their connection.  When father died at the hands of some undead minions under the control of the necro Agravated Death, mother knew right away.   He had been guiding a group into a new settlement area that was supposedly safe.  The only reason mother wasn't with him was because she was working closely with a wizard friend on a secret spell against the undead.  Later, after she finished the research she went after his killers.   Although she took down the undead that killed him the necro-mage got away, she fell into depression and faded away.  There was nothing I could do to help.  I had to watch her slowly die.  I found out later that the research she completed after father died she paid for literally with her soul.  Once her quest for vengeance was over, she had to pay the price.  That is why I know that the undead killed both my parents.  I have hated and hunted them since.  I still don't know exactly what the spell was that she sold her soul for, she  just said that the success would help me and my children against the undead.  Then she named me as the next bearer of the Family Bow of Red Forest.  Only one member from her family attended her funeral and the only reason he came was to pick up the Bow.  He was furious when he found out that she had passed it on to me in front of witnesses even he couldn't discredit.  He never said a word to me just insisted that upon my death the family had the right to the Bow.  I will pass it on to someone who is worthy, for I know that is what she would have wanted.  I will never forget the day that I first drew the Bow.  It felt as if I'd used it forever.  I know there is more to the Bow to discover.     I roam the forests now hunting the undead and protecting the forest.  About 2 weeks ago I came across some poachers who had discovered the nesting area of a pair of hippogriffs.  Unfortunately the only one that survived was the foal that the poachers were trying to steal.  I made sure those particular humans would never poach in my forest again.  The poor foal was tied up and blindfolded, he couldn't walk, see or even stand up.  He was starved and in shock.  Even in the horrible shape he was in I could tell he would be a handsome beast indeed.  His coloration was very rare.  He has a grey dappled hide, darker a little bit towards his hindquarters and on his wings.  It reminds me of moonlight reflecting off the lake on a cloudless night.  He just now is strong enough to walk on his own.  I haven't been able to find another flight that will accept him.  He is growing almost daily now and his appetite never stops.  He is a good friend to talk to here in the woods.  I call him Airienalle and he responds to it now.  One day he will fly again, although up to now he has shown no desire to try.  He seems content to follow me around.  If I leave for more than a few minutes he tends to panic.  I have managed to work my way into safer territory so I don't have to spend as much time away from him scouting for danger.  There is a small hut that I found abandoned some time ago.  It sits close to a little meadow.  We can stay there as long as it takes to let Airienalle grow and heal.  I am almost looking forward to a short break from hunting the undead.    Today, when I was on my way back to the hut I heard a furious scream of rage from Airienalle and sprinted the last mile back to the hut.  When I got there I saw Airienalle in a loosing battle with a griffon who had obviously decided the yearling was just the right size for a snack.  I quickly drew my bow and helped dispatch the griffon.  The amazing thing was that Arienalle had finally figured out how to fly in his desperate run/battle with the griffon.  I checked him over thoroughly and he seemed far more pleased with himself than hurt.  After I patched him up he decided to try his new flying out.  The acrobatics he performed were amazing and glorious to watch.  At least they  were after a few close calls.  I think I can start making plans to go back to work now.  I hope Airienalle chooses to accompany me.  I will pass the word to the traders I know for a proper saddle to ride him when he turns 2.    Another ranger stopped by and delivered some information about some undead armies massing in another forest.  From the description of the leader it is Agravated Death.  They have put out a call for help to all elves who can help in any way.  The community is a small one and an easy target for treachery.  Because of its location, without alot of help, it stands an almost futile defense.  We all know that despite this we cannot let the monsters a foothold into our world.  It is a good distance from here but I cannot ignore the call for help against my ancient enemy.  They can certainly use my skills and knowledge  for facing my foe.   It will be the first major journey that Airienalle and I have taken together.  Until now we have pretty much just patrolled our own Forest and the area around it.  Airienalle is 2 now and assures me that he is up to it.  He has become the best friend I have.  I have to stop by the village and let them know I will be gone for an unknown time so they can make arrangements for another Ranger to cover my territory.  It was like closing a chapter of my life.  I don't think it will be the same when I get back, no matter what happens.  The council gave me a list of magical items to look for and bring back from my travels so they can duplicate them in the future.     "}]}

At least I know that now.  Then, he was an angry, abusive, sorry excuse for a living person.  He didn’t play favorites, he just hated us all.  10 kids and a wife who caused all his woes in numerous ways, as far as he was concerned.  My mother would put up with it for awhile and then she’d blow up too.  She wasn’t as quite as nasty as he was, but it was close.  I’m amazed they got together enough to have 10 kids.  Life was a constant battle for survival as truce was never called.  On their last fight one of them broke a lantern and they were to determined to win the fight to leave the burning house.  They died the way they lived.  In full battle with no honour.    All of us kids were farmed out to whoever would take us.  I don’t  even know there names as we were all referred to as ”Dung-Eater ” or ”Bitch Mistress” or other things far less complimentary.  I don’t know about the others, but the farm I was placed in wasn’t much of an improvement.  I did discover one thing on the farm.  Animals are cool.  They are honest beyond what a human is capable of.  They became my friends.  They learned all my hopes, dreams and wishes.  They heard of the adventures waiting for me, andd the ones that my imagination came up with.  They listened and helped me plot against the evil ones of the realms.  I freed slaves and purged haunted places.  At least I did when I was with the animals.  When I was around my foster parents it was a completely different thing.  They had only taken me on because their son died the previous winter.   They made it very clear I was a poor substitute for their precious son.   Every time they saw me I was made aware of more of my inadequacies, usually while they were trying to toughen me up.  I personnally believe their son is better off in the afterlife than he was in that household.  It was probably a relief to be free of them.  I worked hard in the mistaken belief that I would eventually prove to be of worth.  I learned to plow, plant and harvest.  I spent the winters in the barn for I never \"earned\" a place in the house, warmed by the fire.    I rarely saw another elf as my foster parents were not exactly popular.  Travelers never stopped by to pass the news of the kingdom.  I learned that I could do some healing on animals and myself, it is the only way I survived.  That ability manifested itself after puberty and a severe beating for stealing a radish to feed an animal they no longer had a use for and so had returned to the wild to fend for it's self.   I knew if they found out about it they would use it against me and for their benefit only.  So, after 3 years and many bruises, broken bones and other various injuries later, I ran away from that household.  I made my way as far from there as I could.  Driven, unable to stop, I traveled for 2 seasons at least.  I worked at inns in the stables to earn my keep.  I also would stop and help out farms and such as I continued on my travels.  I didn't know where I was going but I knew it wasn't where I was.  So, I would travel on after a short time.  The summer passed and it became harder and harder to earn my way.  The nights became colder, and longer.  I would comfort myself with the memories of my time with the animals at the farm and those I had dealt with on my travels.  I would dream of finding a place of peace, then I'd wake up to the reality of never having known it.  At last I found peace in a small grove.  Tired, hungry and hurting, my last thought was ”It’s better to die at peace, then die in a useless, honourless battle as my parents did.”  This was my thought as I fell asleep in the falling snow that night.  I woke up in a small, spare room.  The feeling of peace hadn’t left me.  I thought that there was a mistake and I had made it to the summerlands.  Here I didn’t even hurt anymore.  Then the door opened and a man walked in.  He wasn’t classically handsome, but there was such an aura of peace, and power around him, I immediately felt safe in a way I never known.  He invited me to help with dinner and we talked about animals and nature.  As the seasons passed I continued to follow him and he to teach me.  I learned of nature in all her moods and faces.  I learned to heal the hurts of others as he had healed me.  I never spoke of my past and he never asked.  I know he knew of it, but it was important only in that it brought me here.  I learned to talk to the animals in the grove and revere them for what they are.  I know there was a village nearby but I never went there.  Several of the villagers were healed by me when they came for healing.  Then I started wandering and I would stop by the sick or elderly and help them.  I never went to town, just the outskirts and outlaying farms.  As my wandering took me further, so too did rumors spread.  As time passed and rumors spread, I noticed that I liked being out and about.  Traveler's I had never met recognized me when I stopped to help them.  They told me news of far away places.  Fascinating things were happening, and even more were being learned.  That is what I valued most from our conversations, the knowledge that they passed on to me without even noticing.  No one had an unkind word to say to me.  I gradually stopped expecting to get embroiled in a fight every time I came across someone.  So I spent more time out and about and less time at the grove.  I was learning more and more on my own.  I was developing my own interests and hobbies, and though I didn't know why, I was feeling restless.    Then one day when I returned I found Wreathe waiting for me.  He had a bundle with him and an old quarterstaff that I had seen in his sacred grove for years.  I asked him if he was leaving and he just laughed and said no.  \"This is for you and your journey.  I started working on it shortly after you came to me as I knew this day would come.  It was made for you and is attuned to you alone.  To everyone else it will only be a normal quarterstaff, to you it will save your skin. You are healed and it is time for you to go.  The eaglet fledged must fly on her own or she will die.  Speaking of which,\" he nodded his head toward Cyclone sitting on a nearby branch, \"You are not the only one who is healed and ready to start her journey.  As you saved her from the cyclone that both gave her her name and destroyed her family.   A bond has formed between you that will last the rest of your lives.   She’s as impatient to fly in new skies as you are to see new places.  You have a visitor to see before you leave as well.\"  We walked out towards the village road together, I realized I had never taken it before.  I’d seen others use it, but I never had.  There was a committe waiting for us.  It wasn’t the entire village, just some of the people I had helped over the seasons, still there were quite a few of them.  One who I recognized from healing his wife from a difficult birth.  I found out then that he had been elected Mayor.  ”Wreath told us you’d be leaving today.  It didn’t seem right to let you go without some sort of thank you from all of us.  This was left at the inn by someone who got in a fight and ended up meeting his maker.  It was confiscated by the inn keeper for the room fee.  There is 200 and some gold,  38 platinum and 24 gems.  There is also a complete set of plate armor and weapons which we know you can’t use but you can trade them for whatever you need when you get further into civilization.   This here is a bag of holding and it’s a big one so it should hold anything you need it to. There is also 2 mos worth of trail rations supplied by the village baker.  The rest of the kit is the fighter’s traveling gear.  You’re the only one gonna be traveling from these parts for a while so make good use of them.   Last but not least is this here scroll.  It was made up by the bookkeeper so you can be proud to have it. ”  He opened it up and I saw that it was a note saying thank you for all your help, and it was covered in signatures.   ”Everyone you ever helped in these parts made sure to sign it so you’d know how much your help really meant.”   So it was I took to the road once again in a totally new way.

Velth took easily to being overlooked among his family. He viewed nearly all of his time at court as a vast waste of his life and unceasingly boring. Veleth often snuck away from his lessons to spend time in the Library and Arcanery of the palace. It was here that he developed a love of knowledge and all things arcane. The curator of the place was an elderly wizard by the name of Tor’Lial. The two would spend hours together and developed a close bond and Tor’Lial taught him of legends and magics and spells long forgotten.  Pretty much free to do as he pleased his time at the library went on with the consent of his family.  He excelled in his studies and eventually gained employment within the library, being mastered for Tor’Lial for eventual curatorship of the Palace collection.  On Veleth’s 75th nameday Tor’Lial was found dead in his sleep, having succumbed to his old age.  Veleth was devastated and retreated into the Arcanum, brooding among the collection for years. The loss of his friend and mentor having made him dismissive of his family and the outer world he retreated into his position as Master of the Arcanum and made every attempt to learn its entire knowledge.  One winter's evening years later an Emissary of the Greenbriar Collective came to call upon the palace. This agent was on a mission and needed access to the Arcanum and its resources.  The Shalandaerl family being major supporters of the Collective as well as donors were happy to oblige. Alluriel Tarondaelon was a master wizard among the Collective, special professor at large of Evocation and a distant relative of the Shalandaerl family.  A prodigy in her own right she quickly became impressed with Veleth’s knowledge of the Arcanums more obscure references and his ability to come to conclusions on her research before she could herself. From Veleth’s point of view she was unlike anything he had ever encountered. Elegant, beautiful and with a mind as razor sharp and as formidable as his. No one since Tor’Lial had been able to keep up with him, let alone keep his interest as long as she could.  It was with mutual respect that Alluriel approached the Shalandaerl family about his accompanying her on the mission and possible admittance into the Collective.  Supportive of their son and pleased with his sudden interest with the outside world again he was granted permission and set out on his first adventure. Thus at the age of 85 Veleth left Val'Andaerl and would not return again for 200 years, when the city fell into shadow from a Drow plot.  Veleths first mission involved an Oni and disappearing noble children from the city of Green Water.  It was here that they met with Saewon Vanloth an Elven Paladin of Tyr.  It seemed that the creature was stealing noble children from the highest of families during the night and running off to an unknown location.  Saewon had been called to the area by his god, having sensed an evil presence behind the Oni. TOgether the group eventually tracked the Oni down to a cabin deep in the Verdant Expanse, a thick dangerous forest connected with the Feywild.  Here they confronted the Oni and destroyed him, in the process they revealed that it had been infact working for a wild magic sorcerer who escaped with a child deep into the wood. As they pursued the sorcerer they cornered him near a portal to the Feywild. Veleth still new to the use of arcane magics in practical application lashed out with a scroll he had found during the investigation of the cabin. THe use of the scroll nearly killed him and its backlash caused the portal to rupture, wiping the sorceror of his mind and unknown to the group  on the other side of the portal a Hag awaited with her coven for the child prophesized to bring her to great power. With the portal unstable it killed most of her coven and nearly her as well as it collapsed. With the child saved and Veleth revived by Saewon the group headed back into town, but not before Tyr gave a warning to Velth through Saewon.  “Beware the Nights Mistress for shadows gather and the light of the emerald star will fall to darkness.”  Not knowing what it meant but promising his sword should he need it Saewon and Velth parted ways but would have many missions together until Saewon’s death at the Shattered Spire in Dragonmount near Razorwind.  Veleth's strength of character and will and exemplary investigation skills earned him entrance into the Collective and he was granted membership by Alluriel herself.  For another 100 years he studied and apprenticed with various leaders of Arcane and Investigative arts and was Alluriels right hand on missions.  During one mission to the Feywild, Alluriel and Veleth were sent to give aid to Queen Titania. It seemed that there was a mysterious contingent threatening the area. members of the Queen's court had been going missing and they were called upon to investigate, The Collective having owed a Favor from the Seelie Court. Upon investigation they discovered Fomorian involvement. Fomorians having their roots in the Feydark hadn't been seen in centuries.  Once again as they solved the incursion and with the help of the queens warriors, they disrupted the plans of the Hag who was using the Fey blood to spawn a portal to the Abyss. The ensuing battle sent her down her own portal and at the mercy of its denizens. It was after this mission that Veleth professed his love to Alluriel and found it reciprocated in her as well. At the end of the 3 week mission Veleth and Alluriel were joined by Queen Titania herself.  Velth and Alluriel lived a productive life within the collective for the next several decades. Each rose higher in the ranks and at 285 Veleth was granted full Professorship and Tenure.  Shortly after this the collective was called to investigate strange rumors emanating from Val’Andearl. Velth and his pregnant wife rushed to the land of their family to assist the Collective in their investigation.  While there they uncovered a Drow plot as Veleth’s own brother had been under the influence of master enchanter from the Drow and had been feeding information and artifacts from the Arcanum to the Underdark fro years.  For 2 years a battle raged and during that war with the Drow Veleth and Alluriel’s daughter Tiri’len Calemmir was born.  At the end of the war with the Drow it was revealed that they were being used by a demon from the Abyss and the artifacts and information gained from Veleth’s brother were being funneled to this Demon for an unknown purpose.  Once again the Hag was behind the plot but this time she was successful in obtaining a relic vital to her and the Demons plan, she also learned of Veleths daughter and vowed revenge.   75 years passed with the Professor and his family living in peace and prosperity. He became a popular academic and agent of the Collective and a valuable resource for the surrounding continent as well as a formidable wizard in his own right.  In his 360th year he and Alluriel accompanied an adventuring group on their investigation of a Hag coven who had ransacked an ancient temple.  During the course of the investigation it was revealed to be a trap. Veleth was struck down and almost died as the Hag came face to face with her nemesis.  Alluriel fought her with all her might but was in the end also struck down and near death. The Hag then threatened Alluriel with the life of her daughter and offered a compromise.  WIthin the Greenbriar collective was a collection of artifacts she needed, one of them strongly tied to the blood of the Shalandaerl Family.  In exchange for Alluriel’s power and these artifacts the Hag would spare the lives of her family and allow them to live. Taking the deal the Hag used a dark and deadly spell on both the Professor and Alluriel, wiping their minds of the incident. As the Hag escaped she slayed the adventuring party.  When they awoke they were amidst the ruins of the temple and the remains of the party with no knowledge of what had happened.  THe Collective could not deduce the cause or purpose of the covens attack or the loss of Alluriels power and the case went cold.  One year later the Greenbriar Collective was attacked and valuable artifacts stolen. That same day Veleths daughter disappeared, as the Hag enacted her plot and needed the blood of a Shalandaerl in her plans.  For 15 years the Professor searched with the Collectives backing but nothing came to fruition and the case was closed by the Council.  Alluriel and Veleth fell out as she left on her own investigation never to return. The Professor closed himself off to the world again like that day so many centuries before when he lost all that was dear to him. He retreated into his studies and lectures and became absent minded in his heartbreak.     On his 435th year the Collective called upon the Professor once again, pairing him with a young upstart Samson in hopes of breaking Veleths self imposed exile.  They were sent to Harrowmire where he and Samson attempted to stop a Lich that had taken the town hostage.  Through the course of the investigation they met a strange and powerful sorcerer named the Woodsman and with his guidance gained access to Harrowmire.  In the Process of gaining access The Professor was haunted by visages of his daughter by a Nightmare and granted a wish by a spirit of his lost daughter.  Eventually they faced and defeated the Lich as The Professor destroyed the Phylactery but not without having several near death experiences.  Surprised at his survival The Professor found renewed believe that his daughter was alive. Requesting a sabbatical from the Collective the Professor returned to study with the Woodsman. It was during this time that the strange little fellow of considerable power revealed that the Professor was under a strange and powerful spell. With a newfound hope for his daughter and a fresh mystery to solve Velethuil’adar Shalandaerl set off in search of an ancient artifact the Woodsman said would help break the dark magic that had its hold on him and help lead him to the truth.

Her parents despised the surface world and planned on grooming their daughter into a wizard that could give the surface world a reason to respect and fear the Drow, but she had other plans.  Shirking her studies of magic often, she’d sneak off and explore the Underdark, and while still quite young, she discovered an underground racing rink, relatively close to an entrance to the surface world. Here, battlewagons consisted of two people (three if they could afford a larger wagon, one if they were particularly confident/foolish), usually a driver and some kind of ranged attacker, whether by spell or arrow. She was instantly taken by the atmosphere, and would sneak off often to watch the racers, intrigued by not only the racing, but also the wide variety of other races that she’d never seen before.  Realising their efforts were wasted on La’fein, her parents focused on grooming their other daughter, who took to it more eagerly. While a little hurt by this, she took it as an opportunity to check out the racers more often, eventually leaving her home completely to shack up near the racers, still a child. It didn’t take long for her to be discovered, and she was taken to the leader of the rink, an elderly, but still spritely Deep Gnme, who took her in. She spent her youth, and a good portion of her adulthood here. Initially, they tried teaching her to drive, however this didn’t end so well (resulting in a crashed wagon and a few bumps and bruises). They attempted this a few more times, with equally bad results, before trying a different approach. They asked her what she liked most about the races, and she replied with the atmosphere; the adrenaline it gives people. She wanted to do that for others, so, they showed her to one of the races, one of the carts containing a halfling driver, and a human bard, strapped to the top, playing guitar and empowering their wagon. Immediately, La’fein was taken and determined to do just that, so, they taught her, and she took to it quickly.    First, she was taught the drums, which she excelled at, keeping a rhythm came naturally to her, though it took a bit more training to keep up the beat for an extended period of time.  Then, around in her teens now, she took to learning instruments by herself, teaching herself guitar, with the aid of some mentors. Another racer taught her how to play the harp, which she found boring at first, but stuck with it, eventually using it to sooth stressed racers and such. She also picked up a warhorn, encouraging racers before a race (and inevitably getting on everyone’s nerves when she got carried away and overdid it). She studied under many mentors in a variety of instruments and techniques, learning to heal and empower allies, and disable and intimidate opponents. Sadly, during this training, the leader of the ring, who she’d come to look up to as a father, passed away. A new leader of the ring was chosen, and after mourning, she was determined to keep at it to make him proud.  Before long, she was approaching adulthood, and determined to get into the ring and show off her musical prowess. She initially teamed up with another Drow woman, however while they enjoyed racing against each other, their synergy didn’t work out too well while in a cart together, so she introduced La’fein to a friend of hers, a Moon Elf named Gilthar Killevin.  Initially, they argued off the track, but they were in perfect sync while racing. They were both as stubborn as each other, and before long their arguments become more jovial, and they developed a fondness for eachother. She learned that he was a ranger on the surface world. Part of a troop that protected the forests but he came her often on his off time. However due to his work, he’d have to leave the ring every now and then to work, and she found herself missing him.   They grew closer, Gilthar even taking La’fein to the surface world a couple times so she could see it, bringing her back home to the Underdark before the sun rose so she wouldn’t be harmed by the sunlight (and so they wouldn’t encounter any surface dwellers. She never had a chance to tell him, but while the surface was beautiful, she was far too anxious to ever speak to any surface dwellers, despite to confident, hardcore persona she donned while racing)   Before long, they married, and La’fein fell pregnant at 103. I young parent for an elf, but she wanted nothing else at that moment. Midway during her pregnancy, her husband got word of an intense mission which would mean he would need to be away from La’fein for a long amount of time, however he assured her he’d be there for the birth of their child. She said ‘I love you’ and kissed him goodbye. About halfway through this mission is when the Cataclysm hit.   It shook the Underdark, the racing ring caving in, killing many racers. She and a number of other racers, including her Drow friend she’d race against were lucky enough to find themselves in a pocket under the rubble. A number of them being adept mages, they waiting to ensure there were no aftershocks, before making their way to the surface. There, they saw the damage, and it was absolute. Climbing out from the Underdark and touching the surface ground burned and blistered their hands, and while they, and a couple other small groups of racers struggled their way out of the rubble, it his La’fein that the likelihood of her husband surviving such a calamity was near impossible, and she grieved.   Time went on and they soon realised that the Cataclysm was not a once off thing. The mages in their group found their magic going haywire, and the radiation was affecting all of them. Some members of their group died within the week, while the others started to suffer from deformities. La’fein feared for the safety of her child as her own skin paled and blisters after blisters would appear on her hands, rendering her incapable of much, let alone playing music.   A few months went by and La’fein was now late in her pregnancy. While things were still grim, and their group now even smaller, they found they could adapt. Her Drow friend became something of a carer for her while the others managed to scavenge for scraps, eventually turning the rubble of their racing rink into a makeshift settlement. Here, La’fein gave birth to her daughter. It was a long, painful labour, but to La’fein’s relief, a successful one. Her child had the same mottled skin she had developed and her bones were deformed in places. Her knee joints bent in odd ways, and the ridges along her spine protruded through the skin, forming tiny spikes, explaining the painful labour, however her daughter shod no signs of pain. A cleric tended to them both and to La’fein’s relief, they were both alive, and as well as you can be in this new world. She named her Rua. Her little star.   In this tiny, makeshift settlement, she raised her child, and all things considered, she had a good youth. La’fein’s electric guitar from her youth collected dust in the corner of their makeshift settlement, traded in for lullabies and a makeshift lyre. Despite her limp, her child was vital, finding joy in running and playing in the sands around their settlement, finding pieces of charcoal and drawing on whatever surface she could (including La’fein’s guitar, which she had charmed to keep it there permanently). As her daughter grew, she became just as wily and stubborn as her mother. They argued often, but it was never severe, just the result of sheer stubbornness from both sides. Rua would laugh whenever La’fein mentioned her past of playing that old electric guitar on the back of a wagon, saying how ridiculous that was, her mother being anything but her lame old mom. Over time, members of their little settlement left, including her Drow friend. While rare, they had a few visitors. Survivors from other regions, now riding large battle wagons which had become the norm in the large settlements they were supposedly from. Members of La’fein’s settlement were determined to look for better places, so off they went. Radiation had settled by now, and her hands had time to heal over completely, though now permanently calloused and scaly.  As her child grew into a teenager, she showed an aptitude for the sands, and eventually at the age of 98, longed to explore them. A larger wagon happened by their settlement, and Rua begged her mother to let her go with them. Initially she hesitated, but she understood her daughter’s longing for something more, and refused to let her ingrained wariness of surface dwellers get in the way, so she allowed it. And so, Rua left on her own adventure with a band of unruly, but kind-hearted scavengers.   So La’fein was left by herself. She tried to help aid in the settlement, but it wasn’t working for her. A century of staying put in one place had made her restless. So she found her own, smaller wagon, dusted off her old instruments, and rode off in search of her own adventure, far from ready to settle down for good. "}]}

Nai Limael is an elf druid."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "An only child born into a near royal bloodline of Wood Elves, Nai’s early life was bustling with activity. The Limael bloodline had always revelled in celebrations, rather than politics, and for many, they were a welcome change to the boring or depressing politics of the nation. The forest they resided in was often bustling with activity, celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, or throwing festivities for a whole array of deities from the nature domain. Nai’s birth was no exception. The family were overjoyed by the birth of their daughter. She was tiny, with blonde hair, and the same vivid green eyes that were a speciality of the Limaels.   Yet another grand celebration was held for her, the new and only heir of the Nimael family line.   Throughout her life, she was a slow learner. Speech came later to her than most, and Common tongue came to her even later. She could never hold a pencil quite right, and while she was able to pick up Elven script after a while, piecing together the written language of Common proved to be impossible. She was taught manners she didn’t understand, though some made it through (don’t touch things that aren’t yours. Say ‘please’ and ‘thank you’, as it makes people happy), put in frilly dresses that rubbed uncomfortably on her skin, and made to attend a huge number of celebrations every year, each one grander than the last.   Nai quickly grew to dislike these celebrations. People would always crowd her, causing her to cry. She would be flooded with questions she didn’t know how to answer, and everything was just a bit too loud. People greeted her with smiles at first, but it never took long for those smiles to fade, and she couldn’t understand why. Was it something she said?   Despite her dislike for them, these celebrations became more frequent, and even larger. The heads of the Limael family made the decision to start cutting down trees in the area. A common complaint was how difficult it was to get to the Limael residence, located at the heart of a forest neighbouring the coast. As a result, the first course of action was making paths, so more people could attend. Net, they pushed the forest back further, creating new areas for accommodation, so now even those coming from great distances could attend regularly, always welcome to stay in the new accommodation areas. More and more forest was cut back, and this distressed Limael, as well as some of the elder members of the Limael family line. The elders tried to explain that they were straying from their roots as Wood Elves, but their arguments fell on deaf ears. Nai herself tried to speak up. She liked the forest, and didn’t like seeing it get cut down. It meant less squirrels to sit with, less rabbits to run alongside, and the birds could never be heard over the mass of people almost always present. When she tried to bring this up with her parents, she was brushed aside. “Mommy is busy sweetie.”, she said, and this just upset Nai more. She couldn’t understand why they couldn’t see what they were doing was bad. But she didn’t bring it up again.   Many awkward conversations and hurt feelings later, guests learned to avoid conversation with Nai. She didn’t mind so much, it meant she could be left to her own devices, but she wished she knew why. But one day it all got too much. Everyone was too loud, and the forest she loved was barely recognisable. She looked to her parents, who were happily chatting with various nobles, and to her, they seemed happy enough. They had their parties, and plenty of other people to talk to. So, Nai made the decision to leave. She left unnoticed, heading south, and eventually hitting the shore. Kicking off her uncomfortable shoes she was made to wear, she loved the feeling of the sand between her toes, and the quiet, but constant sound of the waves. Much better than that loud uncomfortable “forest”. So, she walked. She headed West along the coast, and she just kept walking.    She dawdled often. Spotting flowers growing just off the shore, she would wander off to pick them and add them to her hair. She’d hours in a spot of sand that had a particularly beautiful selection of shells and rocks, pouring over them and picking a select few to carry with her, always making sure not to take too much from one area.  She travelled alone for a fair amount of time, but it wasn’t long before she found company. Or rather, company found her. Her hair, tousled and tangled from the ocean wind, now housed many beautiful shells, pebbles, and flowers. Certain aspects of it sparkled in the light, and that attracted attention. A young crow, with pitch black feathers and ice blue eyes, took notice of Nai’s hair. Or rather, the sparkly objects inside it, and attempted to grab one for himself. Their first meeting wasn’t the best. The crow tries to yank a particularly shiny shell out of Nai’s hair, but it was tangled in the deeply. After a minute of startled screams, cawing, and hair pulling, the crow left. But it never strayed far. It watched for a day or so, thinking hard. It wanted that shell, but it wouldn’t budge. So, rather than taking the shell to its collection, it decided to bring the rest of the collection to the shell. The crow left, and returned shortly after with a bottlecap, tucking it neatly into Nai’s hair. Nai didn’t mind this so much, and promised the crow she wouldn’t touch it, and keep it safe. Then he took off again.  …And, returned once more, this time with a gold coin. And again, this time with another shell, from another beach far away. And again, with a dried sprig of mistletoe. Before long, the crow had turned Nai’s hair into a new nest. Again, she didn’t mind at all. She enjoyed the company, and decided to name the crow ‘Korko’, which is ‘crow’ in Elvish. Korko cawed in apparent approval of the name, and they became fast friends.   After a long while of travelling together, Nai got her first real taste of the dangers she was facing. A storm hit, and the usually calm, blue coast she travelled along, turned a menacing grey, water choppy and dangerous. The storm directly overhead, lightning flashed and thunder clapped simultaneously, and the water rose to dangerous levels. Pure luck saved her. A natural cave in the stone, high enough to be out of reach of the rising tide, could be seen not far from her. She scrambled out to safety, a frazzled Korko clinging to her hair, and waited out the storm, safe and dry in this cave, just warm enough to keep her comfortable.   The storm subsided, and Nai left the cave, seeing for the first time the havoc nature can cause. A number of fish lay dead of the sand, and in the other direction, Nai could see a far-off forest, and even at this distance, she could see a large number of trees felled by the brute force of the wind. She continued her walk along the coast, and it wasn’t long before she came across something that really hit home how powerful nature can be. An enormous piece of driftwood, not far off of being a full tree, had washed ashore. It lay with its top branches propped up on the cliffs, its roots meeting the water at low tide. Awed, she picked a part of the tree, hollowed out at some point, and used her strength to tear it off. Heavy, and larger than expected, it felt uncomfortable in her grip at first, but it didn’t take long for her to find the best way to carry this encumbering piece of driftwood. But, she had her mind set. This tree had its own, fearsome beauty, and this piece of it served as a reminder that nature is not to be underestimated. So, she kept it, and, taking a leaf of out Korko’s metaphorical book, she started to decorate it.   Unknown to her, it wasn’t luck that had Nai discover that cave. No, it was something more divine. Nai was never able to remember the various deities her family would celebrate. She knew none of their names. But, without her knowledge, these gods and goddesses knew her name, and by now, they knew it quite well. Deities with control over the nature domain found the Limael’s destruction of the forests offensive, and worse still, hypocritical, as I was done it order to supposedly celebrate them. The gods had been keeping an eye on the Limael’s for some time, and seeing Nai simply walk off the way that she did entertained them greatly. Nai’s ‘luck’ was rather a direct result of their influence. Subtle, but just enough to keep her safe and healthy. Berries would come into fruit well before their time, edible tubers would be surprisingly close to the surface, fires for warmth would take just a little bit less to start, and last just a bit longer. Predatory animals would take no notice of the young girl and her crow, and shelter could always be found.  Taking care of Nai as she walked became something of a game for the gods, and even the more sinister deities would take part. The Limael’s, distraught over their daughter’s disappearance, used every means possible to find her, but they never could. Storms would hit any boats searching for her. Searching parties by foot would find themselves hunted by wolves, and through a presence unknown to Nai, any magical attempts to find her were blocked. They searched for years before calling off their efforts, deeming it fruitless, but Nai was always blissfully unaware. She kept walking, with a skip in her step, driftwood in her hands, Korko by her side, and gods at her back.   And so, she kept travelling. Walking along the coast, deciding to see more of the world and taking a detour, before deciding to head back. She had no means of knowing where she was, but she had her own unique way of having a general idea of where she was. Large rock formations that had no other significance served as landmarks, remembered fondly because they looked like her favourite animals, though the resemblance was often very obscure. She zigzagged across the continent, occasionally backtracking, wishing to spend time at a particularly nice creek gain, or turning around to climb a specific tree because she liked the view and wanted to see it again. And throughout all this, the gods would continue to check up on her occasionally, giving her a little helping hand if she ever needed it.   After many, many years of wandering, Nai happens across a vast forest. It’s vivid green, and gorgeous, and lusher than any she’s ever seen before, so, of course, she enters. Unknown to her, however, she’s being watched, and not just by the gods. An elderly, druid man, keeps a careful eye on her, not wanting to scare her, but ready if she ever poses a threat to this forest that he’s become a part of. She wanders among the trees, taking in the sights, but never noticing the old druid. However, on the night of the full moon, she does encounter something peculiar. A disc, floating, large enough for her to step into if she wished. It looks like a mirror, reflected in it, an incredible forest, not unlike the one she’s in right now, but vastly superior. Larger, more beautiful, with plant life growing in ways she’s never seen. She steps into this mirror-like portal, and the druid man, who’s been keeping a careful watch moves to stop her, calling out a second too late. He opens his mouth to yell out to her, but she steps through, and suddenly, she is gone from this plane.  Nai finds herself in a new, extraordinary world, inhabited by creatures and plants she’d never seen before, not on land, nor from the ocean. The trees here are taller than any she had ever seen, and vines wrap themselves around the branches with intricate detail. Fungus grows on the floor of the forest, the fruiting bodies easily ten times bigger than any Nai had ever encountered, softly glowing a variety of hues, and the moss under her feet is softer than any sand. She wanders for a while, progress slow as she pauses to take in all the sites, choosing to take one item from this place. A small skull, the size of her fist, which she adds to her staff. Korko also finds some things of interest, adding a number of odd flowers to Nai’s hair, which appear to settle themselves in, wrapping roots around a small section of hair and happily adjusting to this new, mobile place of residence. It takes a number of days before she finds anyone sentient, and when she does, they’re shocked to see her. A pair of Satyr, understanding that she must be lost, ask where she came in from, and, knowing the lay of this land, agree to help her get home. She learns that that particular portal won’t open for a month, so they show here around in the meantime. While here, she never learns where she is, but she knows it’s beautiful, and extraordinary, and unlike anything she’s seen thus far, so she focuses on soaking up every gorgeous detail of the landscape, from the trees, to winding rivers not bound to any riverbed, to mountains that go high into the clouds.  The month passes in a flash, and before she knows it, she’s guided back to the portal. The satyr wave goodbye, and she passes back through, reappearing in the same location she went through, the same lush forest, which now seems somewhat drab in comparison to the wonders that she’d just seen. But she and Korko aren’t alone in the forest. Standing in front of her is the druid that had been watching her a month prior. He looks as shocked to see her and she is to see him, and finally, he speaks first, asking how she survived and how long she thinks she was gone for. Taken aback by these questions at first, she answers honestly. She was helped by some satyrs, and she was gone for a month exactly. To her surprise, the druid shakes his head, and invites her to come with him. He takes her to his home. A humble shelter, consisting of just a roof and a makeshift bed and fire pit. He introduced himself as Oberon, and he explains that the place she had just been to was known as the FeyWild. When he first came to this forest, he went through the same portal. For him though, he was trapped in there for five years. It took him that long to figure out the timing of that portal, but when he came back through, everything was the same. His memories of the place are fuzzy, but he vividly recalls the state of things before he went through the portal, and he quickly figured out that he had only been gone for 5 minutes. Initially, he thought that time in the FeyWild was just much slowly than this plane, but Nai has proved that this is not the case. He’s been keeping track of time for her, and Nai is surprised to her that a month passed in the Feywild, but here, in this plane, she had been gone for 15 years.   Oberon is surprised by Nai’s relative lack of reaction, and he eventually lowers his voice, asking if she’s a druid. Nai admits she doesn’t know what that is, and Oberon chuckles, saying that’s not a surprise. He asks Nai to stay with him a while, he’s had no company for a long time, and he’d appreciate it very much, as he’s getting older. Nai doesn’t quite understand this, but she agrees.  Oberon is an eccentric old man, but Nai grows to enjoy his company greatly, even if the conversations don’t make sense and are very one sided.  Weeks pass before he says he’s willing to teach her Druid magic. Nai admits she doesn’t know what that means, and he happily demonstrates. Nai watched as he takes a breath, closing his eyes, and then, smooth as silk, his form changes into that of a bear, a little shaggier than average, and pure white. He changes back and immediately Nai agrees. She’s never seen magic like this, and she’s keen to learn, so, they begin.   First, he teaches her Druidic. Teaches her the script, the speech, and how to sense druidic messages in an area, and she takes to it faster than even Elvish. Then, she teaches her to manipulate nature. He explains the Druids don’t ‘control’ nature, they’re an extension of its will, it’s protectors. They’re one with the natural world, and it is one with them. Nai takes to these lessons like a duck to water, and he teaches her the basics of Wild Shape. He teaches her basic survival skills, and gifts her one of his furs, enchanted to keep her warm and dry, no matter what the weather.   He always warns her of the dangers of being a Druidic. Telling her with spite in his voice that there are folk that want this branch of magic gone. He recognises that names are lost on Nai, so her draws out a symbol. A religious symbol, and explains to her that anyone that bears this symbol is not to be trusted. He explains in vivid detail a druid culling, where members of this group targeted and killed many people like them, and almost succeeded. But, some druids survived, and like a flower in crack in cobblestone, nature will grow and adapt, as will the druids. He explains that she cannot use Wild Shape in front of others, unless she absolutely trusts them, and that teaching the Druidic language to anyone other than a Druid is forbidden, and she understand from the tone of his voice alone that she’s been trusted with something great.  However, their time together is relatively short. Reaching the end of his significant life, Oberon falls. He explains the a confused Nai that this is how nature works. Druids are blessed to be able to be one with it for an extended period of time, but every creature has their time, and this is his. She asks what she can do for him, and he simply replies that he wishes to be buried at the base of the giant Oak at the centre of this forest, and she complies. With his last strength, they move him there, and he passes away peacefully. Nai doesn’t understand death, but she knows he is gone. She grants his wish, burying him, and sits by his grave, and in her own, silent way she mourns.   Upon leaving, she takes an acorn from this tree and a memento of her teacher, and much-loved friend. She places it in her staff, and within a couple of days, it takes root and grows, producing a single, bright green oak leaf. Nai doesn’t notice, but since this, the staff gradually feels lighter to her, and is easier to carry, this large chunk of driftwood now becoming a focus for her magic.   She continues her travels, practising her magic whenever she’s confident no one is around. But then, one day, Korko does something he’s never done since their first meeting. He pesters her. He comes back from a flight, scrap of paper in hand. It’s written in common, so Nai doesn’t understand what it says, but she can tell that Korko is trying to tell her something. So, she follows him. She follows him West, and eventually, South, to a small town she would later learn goes by the name of Narazar. "}]}

Include the following information:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The birth of a Forest Gnome is a wondrous thing to behold. I don’t know exactly how other types of gnomes give birth, I’ve never seen it. But us forest folk? Well, it’s a sight. We’re born casting illusions, and some of the more mystically inclined folks in the clans like to say the first illusions of a newborn help set the fate of that gnome, and set them on their path in life, and the majority of the clans tend to believe them. Some, like my cousin Goldencircle, come out blasting growing trees, fountains of arcane life, and the calming glow of the central Forest. Others, like my brother, Brindleberry, show a series of other figures working alongside them, building great tunnels and intricate mechanisms above and below the trees with sweeping gestures of a many-branched wand. So, it’s not all that surprising that  I lived a lot of my life treated like a rare and dangerous thing.   Far from the magical and natural picture-shows of the rest of Clan Forestward, I was born appearing to have blades in both hands. My Uncle, Crosswood, once said “Chirpy (that was his nickname for me between the ages of 20 and 30. More on our proclivity for naming things soon), you damn near gave your old grandmother her death with your appearance. First, the thing with the swords. THEN, you projected all sorts of horrors around the room, each of them running towards you, and each of them somehow missing you, to disappear into some corner or other.” Sure enough, Grandmother Phloremore never really warmed up to me, and always sent me on the most physical and dangerous tasks outside of our warren. She once snidely remarked that it was due to my mother’s Rock Gnome bloodline, and I dismissed it at the time, but thinking back, it’s probably at least partly true.   So, some background on my warren: The Forestward clan, as our name implies, are protectors of our little branch of Home Forest. Mostly, that involves attending to the growth of things, balancing out the workings of predator and prey, leading foreigners away before they can interfere with us, and learning new magics. Oh, the magics. We’re a very studious bunch, us Forestwards. We have a long tradition of sending the best and brightest of us off to the various wizarding colleges of the land, and those best and brightest continue to make a name for themselves for a bit abroad, performing what some think of as miracles, but what we know are family-kept secrets, before coming back by their hundredth birthday to resume the mantle of Warden of Home. In this way, at our coming of age ceremony, the most important part of the week-long festival  is the Magical Aptitude, Recognition and Knowledge portion, or MARK.   My clan never really worried about MARK day, really. Generation upon generation of Forestward names are grown into the top of the MARK tree, and if you touch those names, they’ll show you a preserved illusion of the events that brought them, and our family, the honor and reverence of the surrounding forest. My own MARK test was what some might call an unmitigated disaster. I tend to think it was somewhat mitigated, but that’s neither here nor there. See, as I grew, I was more of the bruiser type, by looks. Tall for a gnome, and far stronger and more acrobatic than my peers, I grew up at the tops of the trees, swinging where others could only occasionally climb, catching the animals unaware in their dens and hunting with their young. I learned how to catch a bird in flight by the time I was 15, how to forage enough meat, nuts and berries by 17, and by the time I came of age at 25, I was fully able to cross the entire Clansgrove unseen carrying several times my own weight in material.   On the day of my MARK, there were five of us up for admission into the wizard’s grove: My forementioned cousin, Goldencircle, who I’ve always gotten along well with and share many childhood memories with; Balliecharm, a young man from the Spectraldeer Clan who I barely knew, but seemed to resent me for some reason or other; Callieflower, who I courted once, awkwardly, and who I could never get anything right around; Calladario, her brother, who liked me fine before my MARK, but not so much after; and myself. The others spoke their charms, summoned their fae creatures, lit their fires, and performed their minor miracles easily enough, to the glee of the judges. As for my MARK, well, the headmaster eventually recovered fully, and the nickname Blunderstab sticks with me to this day. Hell, I self-apply it, to remember where I’m from, so to speak.   Oh, yeah. Names. We gnomes really love naming things, and each other. You might hear of me as Chirpy, Stelfins, Elftalker, Grounder, Cereliphian, Dragonpunch, or Formie, or any of a dozen others, depending on who’s talking. Some of those come from interesting incidents, some just sounded good to someone. Anyway, we name things by our moods towards them at the time, and it changes depending on all sorts of circumstances. I don’t know how you big people do it, keeping just one name all the time for each other, when sometimes you just feel differently towards each other constantly. It just adds a lot of context to how you interact is all I’m saying.   After my MARK disaster, I was denied admission to the Magegrove for further instruction, and had to find my own way. The next couple of years were less than ideal for me. I’d been somewhat shamed, didn’t have much of a career path set for me, and was avoiding everyone who was caught in what was called the “MARK of the long knives,” which is hard in a bustling warren like ours. I took to becoming somewhat invisible, honing my natural skills to the point where I only could be found when I wanted to be. I managed to strike up a few good friendships with local elves, and would occasionally trade them secrets learned from the local animals for lessons in the Fae language and additional blade practice. It seemed a fair trade, and a useful skillset.   Where others might have used these skills to empty the local treasuries and move on, I took to sneaking into the wizard’s grove to peek in on the studies going on there. Some of that might have been friendly competition with my cousin, some might have been to see more of Callieflower. It was my rebellious 30s and 40s, I can’t explain it better than that. Anyway, that’s where most of my magic comes from these days. I saw the effects from a distance in hiding, and have spent the intervening years reverse-engineering the effects using my own latent magical powers. Something in my Rock Gnome blood led me to fiddling about with various materials to duplicate the effects magic couldn’t, and I used that to self-teach myself as, well, I wasn’t sure what I was being called to, just that all this tinkering, stealthily moving about, and being able to out-fight anyone in my clan seemed very important to me.   Taking risk upon risk only could hold out so long, however. Shortly before my former MARK-mates graduated from the local school and moved on to the bigger wizard’s academy, to join others of our clans that had stayed there to teach, that my luck finally ran out. I think it was Balliecharm, actually, who cast a spell I haven’t been able to duplicate yet, that sent me hurtling from the nearby nook I was auditing the class from and into the circle formed by the class.   It was a unique case, as nobody had ever been caught sneaking INTO a school in our long history. It was finally decided that although no crime was committed, it might be best for me and my clan (and by that I mean mostly my clan) if I were to see the world and serve the needs of the Home Forest abroad. I was tasked with seeing the world, righting wrongs, gathering information, and making myself known in the world, but I was never given a timetable to come back and report. I never asked, and I found a kind of joy on the road, so I never sought out the road home. There would be plenty of time for that, later.   That was about 30 years ago now, and I’m approaching the age where a gnome of my station should consider doing his one great deed abroad before settling down in the Home Forest to continue to serve the Braided Clans. My former classmates are almost graduated from their academy, and should be taking their own journeys abroad in the next year to see the world and to enjoy what of it they can. With that in mind, and hoping to maybe see one or more of them on their journey, I recently heard tell of a great unrest on the borderlands to the south, and journeyed where rumor and weather led me, until one night, camping with strangers found upon the road, we were surprised by a goblin attack. The rest, as they say, is history.  "}]}

Despite having a deep connection with the natural world, he often felt like an outsider, yearning for his place in the wider world beyond the sanctuary walls. One fateful day, Aquis made the decision to leave his sanctuary and embark on a journey to explore the lands, using his druidic powers to protect and restore the balance of the natural order.

Her father, Aukitza, was a Genie. Aukitza married a young human woman, Rose, and had their first child, Dinnis. The people of the main Kingdom would torment him for their wishes to be answered, so Aukitza decided to leave to have some peace in their lives. He found a travelling group of nomads that consisted of Clerics and Druids trying to cope with poverty in the harsh deserts to the west. There, they flourished. Rose became a priestess and Aukitza helped raise new temples and barns. Eventually they had another child, Aquis. Aquis, like her brother Dinnis, was a Water Genasi. The two of them could create clean water to fill the reservoirs for the clergymen and poor of the temples. One fateful night, upon arriving home, Rose walked into an ambush that had been set up by a corrupt group of men from the main Kingdom. They demanded that Aukitza grant them a wish, or they would kill him. Aukitza, while inherently magical, actually had no ability to cast a wish. Then, one of the guards killed Dinnis, who was only 7. Aquis watched in horror as her mother and father were helpless to meet the demands of these warriors. They then threatened to take Roses life. Aukitza looked into Aquis' eyes, and with his last words said \"I'm sorry\", as he charged forward attempting to grab his scimitar off the wall, when Rose was struck down. As the guards went to apprehend Aukitza, one of the guards made what appeared to be a killing strike on him and he burst into smoke. The guards started shouting at each other, thinking they could maybe take his daughter for ransom, but ultimately decided to leave because there was nothing more they could do without the Genie who was dead. So they left. Aquis cried until the morning clutching her dead mother, where she ran out of energy to carry on. The tribesmen found her and decided to bury Rose and Dinnis and hold a funeral that night. Aquis remained with the small group of nomads which formed into a small town of 1,000. While she mostly worked in the temple, she was always interested in the druids of their settlement, and noticed that one of them was a survivalist trainer. After filling the water reservoirs in the church, she would go train with the druids, eventually learning interesting magic from them. She vows to get revenge on the band of warriors that slayed her family in front of her, and wields her father's scimitar in the hopes that she crosses their paths.

Life in the mountains is subject to various challenges, from dangerous creatures to the terrain itself, including dangerous storms from the nearby Lucian Ocean. As a result, the Black Lightning tribe has paid tribute to Kord for as long as the oral histories can remember. The Stormlord values strength and bravery over all else, but requires the responsible use of that strength. Clan Nalakigo ensures the tribe lives up to these ideals. They fight to protect what is theirs from the various other tribes of kobolds and lizardfolk that also live in the mountains, but trade with the humans, elves, and other humanoid races that make their homes in the more hospitable lower elevations nearby.  Keothi was raised, like most children in the tribe, to fight, but as a member of clan Nalakigo, she was also thoroughly schooled in Kord's teachings and the healing arts by her father, Ilikan Steadyhand. She earned her name when she was 18, during a kobold raid on the tribe’s main encampment. Keothi held the door to Kord’s temple alone, swinging her warhammer with deadly accuracy, protecting the sick and wounded inside. As she was swarmed, she felt The Stormlord’s power flow through her for the very first time. With a clap of thunder, she threw several kobolds back from the entrance, dead. The head of clan Nalakigo, Uthal Thundercaller, christened Keothi ‘Stormhammer,’ and she became a fully-fledged member of both clan Nalakigo and the Black Lightning tribe.   The Black Lightning tribe owns a relic of Kord: Thunder-Forged, a glass blade made of sand struck by lightning and carried by the head of clan Nalakigo. Six years after Keothi earned her name, she was on the boundaries of the village when another raiding party attacked the tribe. When the attack was over, Uthal Thundercaller was found dead next to a charred corpse, and Thunder-Forged was missing. Manneo Stormchaser, Keothi’s brother, was with Uthal at the time, and was nowhere to be found after the battle. His own greataxe was lying next to the burned body. A search of the area around the village ensued for the assassins and thief, but they and the blade were nowhere to be found. With the threat from the nearby lizardfolk and kobolds and the rumors of the new tribe of goliath revenants spreading from the Ashen Gorge to the south, it was deemed too dangerous to send warriors en masse to search for it. Keothi’s mother, Eglath Lightninghand, was elected the new head of clan Nalakigo and rechristened Thundercaller, as per tradition. Manneo Stormchaser was presumed dead, and the tribe resumed normal life. Clan Nalakigo, however, deemed the missing blade and the murder of two of their members a blight on their honor, and the new Thundercaller sent Keothi Stormhammer to find and recover Thunder-Forged and serve justice for her murdered kin."}]}

His stance is not how I taught him, nor is it anything I’ve seen him do before. His battleaxe is flailing wildly, there is a bloodlust in his eyes that I haven’t seen since…. Damn, I’ve been hit. I was so focused on my brother, I didn’t even notice the arrow coming toward me. Another scar, another learned lesson. Swing down, sidestep, uppercut. Two more out of the way. Two fewer standing between myself and my brother. He needs me. He isn’t in his right mind. He isn’t following the plan. I start to hear the shouts. Not of the small ones, no. I hear my brother. His words are nonsensical, but his fury is palpable. I can feel it in air, I can smell it on the wind. It’s sickening. Parry, sweep the leg. I’m almost to him now. There are six of them. Hell, two of them are supposed to be on OUR side. He seems not to care. He barely seems to notice. In one move, all six men fall. I have to stop him. He’s going to get himself killed. This is unacceptable. “Brother… Brother! BROTHER!” I shout to him, he seems not to notice. Three more of our men and four of theirs seem to have put aside their differences to take my brother down. Lunge forward. Block right. Turn. Swing. The small ones will not stop me, and they will not stop my brother. That is something only I can do. The battleground is calm now. Both armies have retreated, which I suppose means we won. I did not return with the rest. I need to stay and help my brother. He is not well. He finally stirs. I have a hold of him, I must keep him restrained. “YOU WISH TO CHALLENGE ME!?” He forces the words out, almost as though he doesn’t know who I am or where he is. It takes all of my might to keep him pinned down. “BROTHER,” I shout at him. It seems to work, the rage is leaving his eyes. He tries to tell me he is okay, but I know better. With a firm grip of him, I force him to his feet. “Look at what you have done,” I command him. I know this will not be easy for him. It is not meant to be easy. It is meant to help him grow. I can see the horror come upon his face. He did not mean for it to go this far. “Brother,” he asks,” what have I become?” I am unsure of what to say. All I can do is look upon him and hope that I can be strong enough. Strong enough to stand by him, to help him control his fury, to help him become the best that he can be. I will not turn away, brother, for I am all you have left."}]}

He knows his home was near a place called Guathak’s Great Leap (a chasm), which is in the mountains in the top left of the Dunlin map. However, he has little idea where his home might be, as the name is not known by non-Goliaths and there are Goliath settlements all along the northern mountains of the eastern big island.  -After a long journey, he slavers sold him to the brutal slave fighting pits of Dirkheim (central island). Dirkheim is a mostly dwarven city made rich by trade in minerals from the adjacent mountains and as the principal port between the central island and the eastern island. Dirkheim is ruled by the oppressive Black Boulder clan, with the aging Dagmar Bloodbeard at its head. -The fighting pits are also a major source of income for the clan: huge sums are gambled on the outcomes of big fights, and slave owners from across the islands bring their fighters to compete in the hope of collecting a major purse. The clan takes a cut of all transactions.  -The fighting slaves of Dirkheim live together at the bottom of a huge cavern. None of their rudimentary buildings have roofs or ceilings, and guards monitor all activity from a web of walkways above. Supplies and new slaves are dropped in via a system of moving platforms. These are carefully designed to prevent any escapes. -Koivu was raised by slaves, and taught to fight by slaves. The majority of other slaves are orcs, goblins, hobbits, and dwarves; they were either enslaved after being convicted of a crime by the Black Boulders, or were born in the slave pits. Other races were highly prized as slave fighters, particularly very large humanoids (firbolgs, goliaths), and elves. All sorts of half-breeds between different races have been born in the slave pits. -There were three other goliaths in the pits when Koivu first arrived, but these all perished shortly thereafter in the infamous ‘Great Moon Bloodbath’ held to honour Dagmar BloodBeard’s 400th birthday. -The biggest Dirkheim spectacles involved outnumbered bands of elves against some combination of wild beasts, bezerker dwarves and the large humanoid races. This was naturally a great source of irritation for the elven city states of the western island, and had caused several wars in past decades. -Koivu fought his first arena match at the age of 10. Matches involving children were a popular family outing in Dirkheim, and (normally) involved blunted weapons. -Black Boulder tradition demanded that the winner scalp the losers, and these trophies were displayed in the Dirkheim gladiator hall alongside each fighter’s biography. Since many of the slaves knew each other well, they also exchanged a lock of hair prior to every fight. The winner was responsible for both preserving the victim’s hair, and taking over the victim’s own stash of locks. Fighters knew their hair collections intimately, and memorised the name and deeds of each lock’s former owner. A lock collection was generally preserved as a carefully woven rope. -The other thing of great importance to the slaves was their god, Khush, or ‘the chained god’. Almost all of the slaves prayed to Khush each day, begging for easy work, a merciful driver, a chance at freedom, or even a quick and painless death. Worshippers in Dirkheim generally wore a chain of black iron, with a link for each moon they been enslaved.   Koivu developed into a skilled fighter. Given his presence, generosity and natural inclination to fairness, he was also very popular among the other slaves. Under the tutelage of Marmok, a priest of Khush, he became a fervent believer in the need to end slavery across Dunlin.   "}]}

He is a Paladin and belongs to the Goliath race."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Standing proudy at 7’11”, Koloi Stormcaller is the chieftain of Boroza, the capital city of the Skeijeh (cloud goliaths) in the Teeth of Maduros.  Optimistic and always eager to lend a helping hand to the less fortunate, she is seen as a great positive force in her city.  Though she places great value in the traditions and customs of her people, she also sees the value in innovation, hoping to help bring the Skeijeh into the modern world.  She always tries to be patient and understanding towards others, but, unfortunately, Koloi is ruled by her emotions.  She can only be pushed so much before she will push back.  Like most of the Skeijeh, Koloi has grey skin, slightly pointed ears, and icy bluish grey eyes.  Her wispy teal hair is kept back, for the most part, in a loose braid that just barely reaches her waist.  She has a very basic tattoo of five black dots under her left eye, which she received as part of her induction into the Heralds of the Storm King.  All of Koloi's clothes are woven or knitted from the fleece of the cumulobovus bison.  She sports dark brown woven leggings and a deep purple shirt, though these are rarely visible under her armor.  She wears a thin woven \"circlet,\" dyed orange, an azwood wedding band, and two leather-corded necklaces.  The first necklace is a wooden pendant with the holy emblem of Deneth carved into it: a wheel pierced by a lightning bolt.  The second necklace hold five knuckle bones, also carved, but with intricate patterns of leafy branches covered in chains.  She also carries an azwood walking staff, covered in runes and containing a secret compartment at each end.  This staff is very old, and marks her status as chieftain of Boroza.  They say that Koloi was marked for greatness from the moment of her birth. Koloi's mother, Kayen, went into labor right as a fierce summer storm hit. The storm raged for 5 days and 5 nights, all while Kayen struggled. On the dawn of the sixth day, a bolt of lightning struck a tree outside of the house right as Koloi was finally born. The storm lifted, and the shamans of Boroza said that this child received the kiss of Deneth, god of storms. Unfortunately, the labor left Kayen in a weakened state, and, when an illness swept through the village a few months later, she became sick and passed away. Rhudan Brohn, Koloi's father, was captain of the Skyguard (the group of warriors in charge of protecting the settlement and keeping peace) at the time, and his duties prevented him from raising his daughter on his own. Therefore, Sana Handag, Boroza’s head priestess and mother of Kayen, helped to raise the girl. Koloi practically grew up in the shrine, and she sees it almost as a second home. She excelled at the different fighting styles at an early age; that, combined with her devotion to serving Deneth primed her for a spot in the Heralds of the Storm King, a division of the Skyguard who devote themselves to the patron god of Boroza.  When Koloi was 21, the previous chieftain, Vastur Cloudsinger turned 55, ending his term as chieftain. She was elected into the position, and she was appointed with the name Stormcaller. Finding Vastur to have a wealth of information and experience with the trade and export of goods from his past days as a merchant, she eventually asked him to help manage finance and trade. This involved making the the two-day journey to Clove Town to exchange bovus wool for necessities like metals and wood. Not many people in Boroza were willing to leave, and his aid meant that Koloi would not have to take one week out of every month to make the trek. However, having never been outside of the Teeth before, Koloi found life in the bustling city fascinating. Twice a year, she would take her husband Mhasad (and, eventually, their son Trell) with her, and they would spend an extra day there to catch up in current events and to purchase gifts for family and themselves.  Koloi also made a friend in Clove Town: a Halfling woman named Minnie Greycloak.  The goliath chieftain has a fondness for sweets, and, during her first visit to the city, she managed to stumble across Minnie’s bakery.  The two hit it off immediately, and they have been good friends ever since.  Koloi has even knitted her friend a couple of blankets as gifts, though Minnie could almost use it as a tent due to its size.  She would often keep Koloi up to date with the latest news in town, and it was from Minnie that the chieftain learned of the laws and new technologies being developed in Clove Town.  She realized just how isolated the Skeijeh were, and, from time to time, she would wonder if this isolation were hampering her people's growth.  Eight years after beginning her role as chieftain, it was discovered that, somehow, someone had been traveling to the azwood grove in the middle of the night, cutting down eighteen of the sacred trees. Koloi had known that something was wrong, for the past three nights, she had frightening dreams of being ripped apart by a beast. She formed a small scouting party, telling no one but her grandmother and her husband, and they took watch that night within the grove, in case the culprits returned.  It was not long before a group of men and women appeared, saws and axes at the ready, ready to cut down the azwoods. The warriors confronted these loggers, telling them that they had no right to take what isn't theirs. A fight broke out, but these trespassers underestimated the skills of the Skyguard, and they were quickly slain. Koloi and her team found an encampment about a mile away in a small cave. Stashed there were the azwood logs, as well as a contract between some official named Drukhmoor and the former chieftain, Vastur Cloudsinger.  After reviewing the evidence, the Council found the former chieftain guilty of desecration. Stripped of all names and titles, Vastur was Exiled.  During his execution, he claimed that all he had done, he had done for his people.  He said that their way of life was growing stagnant, and that they need to change to adapt to the new world.  His arguments, however, fell on deaf ears, and, with one swift strike of her sword, he was silenced forever.  Koloi now has five of his knuckle bones on a string around her neck. His body was not given a sky burial, as is the custom of the Skeijeh; instead, it was chained to the bottom of a pit and covered with heavy stones, never to reach the skies.  An emergency council meeting was called. The azwoods were the source of power feeding the Azure Ward, the barrier responsible for protecting outsiders from entering Boroza.  That power was waning. The people were at a loss; what could they do to fix this?  After many arguments (and one cracked table), Koloi proposed that they should try to cultivate the holy trees, in order to increase the barrier's power back to full strength.  There had been rumors of azwood saplings appearing where none existed ever before: one on an island with sandless shores, another in the middle of a sweltering jungle, and the last at the base of a mountain with the face of an elderly man.  According to the old stories, these trees could be sought out, and their cultivation process could be determined.  Some council members thought that this was a foolish task; it could be considered blasphemous if they tried to replicate a gift of the gods.  Others thought that it would not work, because, even if they did manage to grow new azwoods, they may not contain the power that would be required to maintain the Azure Ward.  The journey would be for nothing.  Koloi told the Council that, if these actions offended Deneth, he would let her know.  And, if this plan does not work, then they must change their way of life.  Though his actions were reprehensible, the Exiled was right about one thing: they have been all too willing to cut themselves off from the outside world for too long.  There had been an increase in the emigration of young Skyeh from the Teeth.  More and more of their people grow curious of the outside world, a world that they choose not to acknowledge.  This ignorance, Koloi said, will be their downfall.    Koloi offered to take on this task herself, as it was her duty as chieftain to protect her people (and since nearly everyone else was too afraid of the outside world to leave). She appointed two interim chieftains to take care of Boroza in her absence, and, after a few days of preparation, she and the two temporary leaders set off towards Clove Town, so that she could introduce them to the trading contacts.  Head Priestess Sana promised that she would keep in contact with Koloi from time to time, to give her updates on the village and to check in with her.  A successful trade contract drawn up, Koloi parted ways with the two chieftains.  She returned to her favorite inn, the one where she always stayed in Clove Town.  During dinner, she struck up a conversation with a sweet little gnome named Wrenn.  Intrigued by his tinkering skills, she offered to introduce him to her husband Mhasad one day, as the two of them would get along wonderfully.  Wrenn seemed delighted, and did not mind that it would be a while before Koloi could do so.  After talking late into the evening, they both finally retired to their separate rooms at the inn.  That night, Koloi was attacked by an assassin in her room. The killer was no match for the towering goliath, and, in self-defense, she killed the man. Guards came, and she told them all that had happened. They accepted her story and moved on. However, when morning came, she awoke to no less than ten guards placing her in chains, claiming that she was guilty of murder. When asked who made this claim, they showed her the official warrant, signed by one Ezekiel Drukhmoor.  The Stormcaller felt her rage swell within her, and the last thing she could remember was strangling some poor soldier before a sharp blow to the back of her head knocked her unconscious."}]}

My story  is one of  bizarre coincidences to be sure.  First off my family’s legacy of a magical bow is mine without any instructions.  I know my elven relatives are quite affronted by my  mother’s temerity in naming me as the bearer of the bow.  I know that it has a long and involved history, even if I don’t know what that is.   It is a family heirloom.  The one obvious thing that it does is magically create it’s own arrows.  I know it glows sometimes but I haven’t decided if it glows around danger or evil, to me or it.  My teacher I think knows more but chooses not to tell me for promises to my parents who were great friends of hers.  I know that she decided to take me on out of friendship for them and I think, regret that she was not there to help when they needed it most.  My parents were well known as hero’s and adventurers even while they  were shunned for being together and even more after I was born.  They didn’t care what their families and friends thought, they belonged together and that was that.  The 2 of them together were a sight to see, you could easily visualize their connection.  When father died at the hands of some undead minions, mother knew right away.   He had been guiding a group into a new settlement area that was supposedly safe.  The only reason mother wasn't with him was because she was working closely with a wizard friend on a secret spell against the undead.  Later, after she finished the research she went after his killers.   Although she took down the undead that killed him, she fell into depression and faded away.  There was nothing I could do to help.  I had to watch her slowly die.  I found out later that the research she completed after father died she paid for literally with her soul.  Once her quest for vengeance was over, she had to pay the price.  That is why I know that the undead killed both my parents.  I have hated and hunted them since.  I still don't know exactly what the spell was that she sold her soul for, she  just said that the success would help me and my children against the undead.  Then she named me as the next bearer of the Family Bow of Infinate Arrows.  Only one member from her family attended her funeral and the only reason he came was to pick up the Bow.  He was furious when he found out that she had passed it on to me in front of witnesses even he couldn't discredit.  He never said a word to me just insisted that upon my death the family had the right to the Bow.  I will pass it on to someone who is worthy, for I know that is what she would have wanted. "}]}

He lived in the city with his mother until he was six years old, at which point she died suddenly and tragically, leaving him alone in the world. Sovan was entirely unequipped to fend for himself on the streets, surviving more by luck than skill. He was on the edge of starvation, too faint from hunger even to look for food, when a green dragonborn child approached him in an alley and offered him a sticky bun. Suspicious, but too hungry to say no, he let her approach, and ate the bun.  When she realised how desperate he was, the child offered to bring him more food the next day, and over time, Sovan and Fær became close friends. She snuck food to him whenever she could, and protected him when the older urchin children would try to steal from him or beat him up. With Fær’s friendship and protection, Sovan had a fairly happy childhood, despite his circumstances. They played together almost every day, and Sovan made up games for them and sang her songs he invented.  When he got a bit older, Sovan eked out a meager living singing at low class taverns. He knew he was talented enough to do better, but no one would take him seriously due to his lack of social connections and generally shabby appearance. He was desperately jealous of more successful bards, especially the well-known and well-loved Tütz Malüts.  Sovan’s big break came from a surprising source. When Fær and Sapphira got married, Sovan’s wedding gift to them was an original song, written in the style of traditional dragonborn love ballads and performed at the wedding in flawless draconic, which he learned for the purpose. Sapphira’s family connections meant that the wedding was overflowing with wealthy dragonborn elite, who were equally charmed by Sovan’s talent and the novelty of a half-elf performing draconic music.  From that point on, Sovan’s life improved immeasurably. Sovan became a highly desired performer at high class dragonborn events, and the head of the Bella Cuprica clan (Sapphira’s extremely rich and important family) took credit for “discovering” him and became his patron.  A few months later, Sovan decided to write a song about Sapphira and Fær’s honeymoon trip to Silanya. He started researching the new continent, conducting interviews with sailors who worked on the ships that traveled back and forth between the continents. A particularly successful interview resulted in Sovan being invited back to her berth, and a misunderstanding of the ship’s schedule resulted in him oversleeping and still being aboard when the ship cast off for Silanya.  During his accidental journey, Sovan forged close friendships with most of the crew, and planned to make a short visit to Sila to see his friends and the town before re-boarding the ship and traveling home with them. However, a massive storm destroyed the ship just before it reached Silanya. Sovan managed to swim to shore on a piece of flotsam, but nearly everyone else drowned, and Sovan was sufficiently traumatized to swear off boats for the foreseeable future.  Now that he was trapped in Silanya, Sovan basically thought “Well, I’m here anyway, may as well have an adventure” and joined the guild."}]}

In the kingdom where her order resided, a lord and his order of knights demanded the secret knowledge the sisterhood retained regarding neighboring factions. To the angered disappointment of the lord, the sisters refused to get involved and locked away any books or scrolls relevant to what the knights were searching for. Weeks later, on a fall night, Sydna awoke to screams and metal footsteps. The knights had broken into the compound and began ransacking and slaughtering the sisterhood. Sydna ran to her mentors room where she was already ushering in some of the younger sisters into a secret passage. As Sydna was the last to crouch into the passage, her mentor gave her a book of gods before sealing the entrance with her on the other side. Sydna rushed down the passage, as she heard the sounds of swords penetrating flesh echoing behind her. Once she caught up to the few remaining sisters of her order, they exited the passage well outside of the complex but much to their dismay, they turned to see what was once their home ablaze with knights riding about rounding up any survivors. The other sisters decided the best course of action would be to move with the cover of night and head towards a neighboring nation with a known sisterhood of Oghma. Sydna however could not ignore a growing pain and anger in her heart and so she opened her gift from her late mentor and frantically scanned the pages for a suitable god to call upon (as clearly she felt betrayed by Oghma for letting this happen). Her mind felt ashamed but her heart and eyes could not be pulled away from the entry on Shar, The Mistress of the Night and Lady of Loss. She called upon the goddess to smite the knights and lord that had caused her such pain and much to her dismay, the Mistress obliged. Sydna only remembers through her tears and sobs, a dark figure approaching her, wiping the drops off her face and asking \"do you promise to serve me? To seek vengeance against all who oppose me?\" And in her heart she replied yes. Shar entered Sydna then and began to lay waste to the remaining knights who had not returned to their castle, silent as a shadow and deadly as a storm. At dawn, Sydna awoke in the rubble of her fallen order, charred bodies she recognized and mutilated armored bodies she did not, lay about her in the destruction. Looking over her body, with new power coursing through her veins, she recognized Infernal script written all about her torso and upper arms. They state repeatedly \"I serve the night mother, I wield the shadow weave, and I will have my vengeance\". Looking out past the destruction, once again she saw the shadowy cloaked woman, but this time a large armor clad devil stood beside her. The devils form dissipated into shadowy smoke with hellfire burning throughout and rushed through Sydnas body. \"You are now bound in service to me, you will offer your accomplishments to me, and seek out the Order of the Dark Moon for greater truth and power\" spoke the lady, at which point she vanished. Sydna searched through the rubble for her mentor and retrieved a necklace to her former patron Oghma, in honor of her past. As she lit ceremonial incense for safe passing of her mentors soul, her body began to burn into black smoke. Sydna does not know if her mentors spirit passed on to Oghma through her ceremonial rites, or if she had damned her to servitude to Shar, but as such Sydna now offers souls to the god that she once knew, and the goddess she's now bound to and let's the dead settle their disputes. With no where to go nor anyone to turn to (as Sydna knows nothing of her past other than she was an orphan who was taken in by the sisterhood) she ventured out in hopes of finding the Order of the Dark Moon to obtain enough power to destroy the kingdom that wronged her and took away the only family she knew."}]}

I guess I should start at the beginning.    My name is Sascha Treeburn and I am a fighter primarily.  I also discovered that I have a small talent for magic as well.  My village was destroyed when I was a toddler but I was rescued by the Forrest Witch that lived nearby.  She said that the animals came crying to her saying that the evil one had come to destroy the peaceful village that legend said a defiant one would arise from that would be his undoing.  To keep this from happening he sent an entire army to utterly destroy the village and every man, woman and child in it.  He has a reward out for the head's of all who were from there as well.   Me, he does not know of as everyone believes me to be the bastard daughter of the witch and a spell entranced knight.  That lie was spread for my safety.  I do not believe I am the one foreseen to cause his destruction, but I will take him down given half a chance.  His name is Nikeal Angrenian and after all he has done he deserves to die and I hope I can help him on his journey to hell.    My mother, yes mother for she has raised me, told me I needed to go and find my niche for myself. \"I have traveled long and far to find my home, the spot that is my own.  The journey was only as important as the knowledge gained from it.  This is the home I found, the life I chose, now you must do the same.\"   Then she went to an old, ancient tree and said a spell or perhaps a prayer of some sort, the tree started to burn with a strange, magic fire and then it was consumed from the flames and in it's place was an ordinary looking bag.  She picked it up and opened it.  She put her whole arm in it and pulled out a round object, kinda the shape of a plate w/o the center.  It has a reddish tinge to it.  Even then I could tell there was something special about it.  \"This is from my family, it is a chakram of fire and has saved me many times.  You are the true daughter of my heart if not my body.  To you I give this and a small bag of holding stocked with what you need to start your journey.  It is the same thing which my mother gave me and one day you will pass it on to your child.  When the time comes and your journey ends it will once again become the tree of burning for disguise and protection.  So walk this world with pride and no regrets Sascha TreeBurn, it is waiting for you to make your changes.  Do not waste your time or attention on fools or idiots, save it for those who are worthy, judge not from appearance but from heart which is where true treasure lies.”  Since then I have traveled far and learned alot.  I have discovered that I have within me the ability to do magic.  I am learning more every day.  I have learned and earned a familiar, his name is Copper and he is a weasel.  His mere presence makes me feel stronger.  I can see thru his eyes as if we are one.  I can read his emotions, what there is of them.  The more he is around the stronger our bond is.   Copper’s personality is becoming more defined as time goes on as well.  I am trying to teach him to detect traps, magical items, and gems.  He is figuring it out more and more.  He is very mischeivous as well as curious.  He is always finding something interesting and bringing it back to me.  A couple of times he has brought me jewelry he obviously just dug up.  Nothing magical unfortunately but worth something when I cleaned it up and sold it as costume jewelry.  I found  ”FlameHeart” a greater sword of Fire, this is the sword that I carry now.  Of course, I carry my family Chakram of Fire as well as a long bow.  The spells I have learned are few, but very useful.  I’ve picked up a few other things as well.  It was weird I could have sworn I was sitting at camp, getting ready to roll up in my bedroll and then with out any warning I was standing in a road in a field.  There were 2 others there, the one I recognized was one-twoly, a large human.  The other was someone I’d never seen before, a dwarf who introduced himself as Da Morgan, he appears to be a cleric.  We decided to head towards the mountain in the distance.  It took all day but we found a cave entrance and decided to do some exploring.  We went down the passage and came across a large room that looked like a temple.  In the center there was a shield and a hammer. one-twoly picked up the shield and it transformed to look like a pair of  bracers.  No one could lift the hammer and so we left it.  We found three boxes on a shelf in the back of the alter.  We each took one and opened them.  Mine had a copper headband that I decided to wear.  I put the box in my bag and continued to look for further treasure.  Copper found a hidden passageway and there was an alchemist’s lab at the end of it.  There was a shelf of extremely rare spell componets that I took all of and another of potions that I stocked up on.  We found another room that was full all kinds of things.  I found a magical elven thin blade, some boots, a set of bracers, 2 bracelets, a necklace and 8 rings to wear.  I put a bunch of other stuff in my bag.  I keep seeing the same design on all of this stuff and I think it is a forge mark of some kind, this stuff looks like masterwork quality stuff.  Copper found enough bracelets to entirely cover his body.  He looks kinda cute, like a weasel ready for battle.  The guys got weapons that actually talk to them.  My sword doesn’t talk, at least it hasn’t yet.  Copper led us to another room that had a bunch of switches in it.  We finally got them turned to the right combo and 4 doors opened off another big room.  We decided to take a break before when any further.  There was nothing else of interest in the caves.  It took awhile but we made it to town and each decided that even though it had been profitable, it was time to make our own way.   "}]}

Make sure to incorporate the following information."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " Born the third child, and first son of Seraphina and Brinyold Fev’rton (II), Brinyold found much of his life planned out for him from the very beginning. His parents were the front-runners of what had quickly become a household name. Using their combined knowledge of craft and magic, they specialised in producing many enchanted goods for common folk, introducing a little bit of magic into the household lives of those that would probably never see it otherwise, aiming to make general living and labour just a touch easier, and more interesting. With his wife’s encouragement, they also branched out to creating armour, which also boomed, becoming a well-known name for many militia, and many soldiers can boast that their lives were saved by the plate mail bearing the Fevr’ton family crest. However, the happy couple has both agreed to never use their company resources for any objects that may be used in battle, a fact that Seraphina told her first son many times over.   Brinyold was raised to be the heir of such a company. A large task, considering its booming popularity. He looked up to his two older sisters, Lilith and Dimetra, and though he believed that either one of them would be better suited to the task, the role was given to him. His father was a kind man, but rather old fashioned in his views, believing that a male heir would benefit the company more.  So, Brinyold was kept indoors to study, while he watched his sisters longingly, watching them both become people he admired greatly, and had a strong relationship with.   He was close to his parents, and took to his studies without complaint, realising that a person who feels sick at the thought of going outside and getting muddy has no place in the adventuring lifestyle that his siblings had found themselves in. So he stuck to it, growing into a fine young man that friends of the company admired and saw much potential in, despite seeing him so rarely.   On the cusp of adulthood, however, his mother fell ill. An illness that not even the most divine clerics could identify, and sadly, she succumbed to it, dying in her sleep surrounded by family. Brinyold and his sisters, now older and in their own positions of power (Lilith a respected arch mage, and Dimetra the head of militia, both situated in one of the largest cities on the continent), mourned the loss of their mother, a who was a kind and understanding women that all three had a close bond to. Their father, however, had taken a cold turn. Not long after the passing of their mother, and almost immediately after Brinyold’s sisters returned to their city, he had found himself a new spouse. A fellow Moon Elf, Aravae. Within the span of just under a year, they had married, and had their first child; a full Elven blooded son, which threw Brinyold’s life into a spiral. Addressed with a cold demeanour, the news was broken to Brinyold that a full elven heir would be a far better suitor for head of the family name. So in a flash, Brinyold’s rights were revoked, handed to a half-brother that Brinyold had never bothered to remember the name of.  Harbouring a resentment towards his new step mother, and a sense of betrayal towards his father, Brinyold took his first independent step. He decided to leave. …Or, he tried to. It took many attempts to gather the courage to go outside, so he started small. A trip into the garden, a walk through the marketplace. Eventually he built himself up enough courage to be able to go outside without too much of an issue. Touching people without his gloves was still out of the question, and dirt of his boots still caused discomfort, but it was as good as it was going to get. This delay worked in his favour, however. Despite his mother’s promises, Brinyold heard via trusted servants that Aravae had plans to change the company. They would start building weapons, and that plans for new, deadlier weapons were in progress. Wanting the Fevr’ton name to have no part in this bloodshed, for his mother’s sake, he started planning.  He played it casual. Now that he was no longer heir, he had nothing stopping him from going on his own travels, as he put it, though there were many who questioned if he had what it took, including Brinyold himself. But nevertheless, after a number of attempts, he found himself working up enough courage to pack what he needed, and set out on his own, out of the city. But, not before running one last errand. He made a trip into the city’s slums, and eventually, into its’ crime circle, and, despite the ridicule, he was able to find the man he needed for the job. He hired a rogue, famous for his silence and quick hands, and ordered him to steal these weapon blueprints, replacing them with altered copies. At first glance, they appeared the same, but the calculations on the forgery were nonsense. The rogue returned to Brinyold the next night, blueprints in hand. He paid the rogue handsomely for a job very well done, and set out of the city, hiring a carriage to take him to the nearest town. Blueprints in hand, and Aravae’s plans to change the company taken back a few notches, he set out on his journey.   Arriving in the next town, it clicked now how widespread his family’s name was. Armed with just his belongings, weapon blueprints, and a silver tongue, he realised that the Fevr’ton name was rather well known, and he felt a melancholy feeling in his heart whenever he saw the family crest on items his mother had a hand in creating. Determined to make good use of this head start he’d given himself, he got to work.   Using his family name, he gained access to many a library and laboratory in this new town, studying these blueprints intensely and tinkering when he could. Progress was slow, initially, but after a while, he found himself passionate about the craft. Oil on his hands no longer made him sick, and it clicked that he only felt this way about things that he loved dearly and was passionate about, things he no longer saw as gross. Before now, that honour was only held by his sisters and mother. But once he stopped being afraid to get his hands a little oily, progress quickened, and before long, he was able to fill in the blanks of this blueprint, creating the first firearm. However, making it proved to be the easy part. Making it /functional/ took far longer, but after many months of challenging work, experimenting with triggers, and ammunition, he finally did it, putting a smoking hole in a barrel a good foot lower than the bottle he was aiming for.   Even with this success, he kept working. Figuring out the fastest ways to reload, how to keep the hand steady when firing, the best stance to take, and so forth. He kept his creations a secret, as if word of a weapon like this found the ears of his family back home, there would be hell to pay.  He’d created the first firearm, and had a head start, but this head start was short lived. While he continued to create, and experiment, word reached this town of new, dangerous weapons being distributed by the Fevr’tons. The production of such weapons was set back, sure, but having many experts on tinkering at their disposal, it didn’t take them long to overcome the hurdle Brinyold had set for them.   He still had a head start though, and Brinyold planned on utilising it. He still had a weapon unique to him, and he aimed to use it to take back the company that’s rightfully his, and bring it back to the peaceful glory that his mother had envisioned for it. "}]}

One day, down on his luck he tried to rob a dwarf. The dwarf was a cleric by the name of Griff.  Griff took the child on as one of his own and taught him to read, write and navigate.  Griff’s family cared for Ulric and he repayed them by working hard. He ended up being a sailor in the navy. Six months ago, he returned to Dalfor in Eastport and has learned of Griffs death. Realising that he doesn’t have the adequate skills to avenge his father he went to a secluded cave near Highview that Griff had showed him in his youth. He had been told that it was a source of power and that when he wanted to learn the truth, he should come here. He began to meditate.  Three months later, he began to feel that a presence was watching him. After a further month, he heard a voice calling his name. “Ulric, child of my blood, why do you torment yourself?” a deep resonating voice boomed. Ulric opened his eyes to see an ominous fire dragon standing before him. He croaked the only word that he thought of “Power” he replied. The fire dragon made a noise that sounded like cannons and explosions, Ulric was dimly aware that the dragon was laughing. The noise ran shivers through his spine. “That, my child, is easy, but I will help you along” The fire dragon pushed one claw towards Ulrics head. To his credit, he didn’t flinch.  Something awoke within Ulric, the power of a Draconic Sorcerer.  His skin tingled with raw energy. He could feel the anger and rage swell in pure power. For a further month he trained, honing his craft and then left the cave. He has now made his way to Vakrie, where, using his last few coins he has managed to gain transport with a caravan to Nashwall. He looks towards his destination and vows to make anyone involved in Griff’s death pay for what they’ve done."}]}

She glanced at the man next to her, and then lifted the glass lamp further aloft. The sudden blaze of light fully illuminated the features of the infant they both regarded, and the woman slowly shook her head.  “It’s slight, but noticeable. We’ll have it done in her fifth year so we can be certain it takes.”  The girl applied a final bit of pigment over her cheekbones and dropped the cosmetic palette into her bag. She looked nervously at her reflection in the hand mirror, feeling the woman’s eyes boring into her back. Squaring her shoulders, she turned to face the spymaster with her head held high. She knew that she had gotten the disguise perfect this time.  As the woman’s eyes traveled ever so slowly over the girl’s form, the girl’s confidence wilted. The spymaster could find even the tiniest flaw in a disguise, or so the others whispered. Bridget didn’t want to have to repeat the false identity lessons for a third time. Having to do them a second had been humiliating enough, and her cheeks flushed with the remembrance.  “You need to blend a darker tone along the scar tissue to make it unnoticeable, even in bright light. Otherwise, it’s acceptable.”   Bridget could hardly believe her (admittedly, scarred) ears. That had almost sounded like praise coming from the spymaster. She bowed to the woman, gathered her bag, and practically ran from the room. The rest of the Ravena trainees wouldn’t believe it, but she had to tell them anyway.  The girl rummaged through the drawers of an ancient oak desk, sorting through scraps of parchment. None of the documents held any information pertaining to the royal family at all, let alone intelligence on the suspected assassination. Bridget frowned to herself but kept hunting, looking for anything that could be of use for House Ravena.  After another few minutes, the sound of footsteps approaching the office warned Bridget to hastily rearrange the jumble of notes. Reaching into her belt pouch, she crumbled a bit of hardened sap between her fingers and faded out of sight just as the door opened.  Bridget appeared again in the alley behind the warehouse, then strolled casually out onto the main merchant promenade of Vercentis. After a little distance she stooped down to retie one of her boots, her hands moving almost imperceptibly beneath her cloak. Straightening, she glanced down at the hidden glyph she had created on the cobblestone, then sauntered away. Her assignment was complete, and she had a caravan to catch. "}]}

While Harvey was away on a business trip, he and a noble elf woman had a bit too much to drink and things got steamy. Upon his birth, the elf woman told Harvey that the child would either be left in the woods to die (lest she bring great dishonor upon her house) or Harvey could come collect him and raise him as his own. Harvey and his wife, Elena Fisher-Mitsubishi were unable to conceive, so they took his bastard son in. Jimmy was basically raised by his goblin nanny Girbna. She taught him to speak goblin at a young age. Every morning Girbna would sit Jimmy down and look him in the eyes and say, “you is kind, you is smart, you is important.” The help at the family estate all wear a steel collar with the family crest. The collar is enchanted and makes the wearer loyal and subservient. Being the result of an affair, Elena resented Jimmy. To add insult to injury, Jimmy is the heir to the Fisher Forges Company. Elena’s father, Chadsworth Fisher, sold majority shares of the company to Harvey so Harvey can choose who gets the company after he retires. Harvey was always away on business trips, so he didn’t really spend too much time with Jimmy. The only time all three of them were together was on holidays and the rare family vacation. Jimmy grew up in luxury and believed he wanted to continue living this way. The expectation was that he would take over the company when the time was right. He attended University of Norseheim where he majored in marketing and business administration, with a minor in goblin studies (he got a 5 on the AP Goblin test so a minor was just four more credits and he figured might as well). It took him 5 years to finish because he kept taking electives in the arts, particularly theatre and dance. He participated in yearly service trips to build homes for underprivileged goblins in the east, was a brother of Phi Alpha Gamma, and student body president his senior year.   Whlie in college he learned forgery and sold fake IDs to his fellow students. While scavenging for supplies one day, he found a book that refused to hold ink, which he used to inspire confidence in his clients, having them believe that their criminal transaction was being kept secret by magic. In reality the book is a lich’s phylactery. His forging skills culminated in being able to forge his own scroll of pedigree and hide the fact that he’s a bastard. He’s not ashamed of being a bastard necessarily, but having something other than a ring to back up his nobility made for a more enjoyable social experience. Jimmy never quite felt like his place was running the family business. He resolved that after college he would leave home to find himself and a place where he belonged. Shortly after leaving Harvey was able to get a message to Jimmy demanding him to return and assume his duty, and if he did not return within a month then he would put a bounty on him."}]}

Quinoa's father was  King Bulgur II of New Ark. A tall, thin Sun Elf. Calculating, warlike, protective, and strict. Had a tendency to underestimate his son. Trained Quinoa in courtly arts and customs, though Quin had a difficult time understanding and parsing them. Once he determined Quinoa was too ‘soft’ for traditional combat training, he enrolled Quin in the city’s best clerical seminary. Quinoa didn't have the best relationship with his father, who tended to look down on his son’s more scholarly interests, and upon his father’s death, Quinoa ran away from the Keep.  Quinoa's mother was Queen Chia. Chia was kind to Quinoa and was a calming influence in his life. Chia was deeply devoted to Azuth and instilled a love of reading in Quin - she read him some of his first books. She was also a linguist, and maintained that they spoke Elvish in the keep to keep Quinoa attached to his royal heritage. Unfortunately, Chia died when Quinoa was on the cusp of becoming a teen, and was not there to support him through his unsuccessful military and courtly training. Quinoa spent great lengths of time in the Keep’s extensive library and had read almost all its volumes by the time he came of age. He entered clerical seminary in his late elvish-teens, and only attended for two years before he ran away from New Ark. Due to his protected upbringing, nervous demeanor, and the lack of followers of Azuth at the school (most clerics studying at the seminary followed sun, fire, or water gods), Quin lacked many social skills or commonalities needed to form close bonds with other potential clerics - though he desperately wanted to. Quinoa tried his best, but his tendency to speak at length about his special interests and his penchant for going very quiet and still when he wasn't sure how to proceed in a situation (whether combat-related or societal) tended to alienate him from most of his peers. Quinoa has never really had friends before. He knew many of the Keep staff, but many of his caretakers were much older than him and tended to keep an arm’s length from him in personal matters to remain professional.   At one point, he became so desperate to learn to make a friend that on one of his early semesters in seminary school, while away from the Keep, he hired a prostitute simply to have someone to talk to. This person’s name was Yuca - he took quite a liking to Quin after meeting him and found his bashful and nervous nature endearing. Yuca became Quin’s first real friend.   The two became fast friends, often venturing out into the streets of New Ark together on adventures. Yuca was Quinoa’s first kiss - Quin wanted to experience one and felt awful for asking until Yuca assured him it was ok - but nothing ever became of them romantically as they were more inclined to be friends. As his studies became more intense, Quin and Yuca fell out of contact, and he hadn’t seen him before he ran away upon hearing the news of his father's death."}]}

His mother is a human and his father is an elf, although his father has not been present in Bellamy's life. Bellamy is indifferent to his absent father and his mother doesn't ponder the topic often either. Because Bellamy never met his father, he took his mother's last name. While Bellamy has a positive relationship with his mother as one of mutual admiration, they are not very close because his mother was often too busy to parent him properly. Bellamy considers the fact that he was not really raised by his mother as a positive because it has allowed him to grow up learning from a spectrum of people in his environment and allowed him to grow into a diverse and unique individual.    Bellamy received an in-house education intended for nobility, because his lord recognized that half-elves usually make reputable diplomats and Bellamy was the only half-elf in his mostly human court. As a child, Bellamy's social interaction was largely limited to the lord's courtiers and tutors with the occasional guest interaction. Bellamy has a naturally likable personality stemming from his penchant for optimism and his pursuit of understanding new perspectives. Bellamy was an enthusiastic student, especially with natural science, language, history, and music. He spent much of his free time as an adolescent reading or drawing in the gardens, conversing with guests and sharing stories.    In Bellamy's teenage and young adult years, his personal freedoms had extended beyond the grounds and into the surrounding town. He had been groomed for diplomacy and was still in the process of learning, so his training often led him to interact with common people as well as vassals and traders. However, his tutors did not bother to assign such activities to him because he could often be found interacting with these people outside of his studies regardless. Bellamy grew a compassion for common folk, finding them to be more honest than the average noble. He began to spend time in popular social spots around town and played music for money on occasion.    In Bellamy's adult life, he has worked as his lord's public assistant. It's a decent paying job that comes with most of the amenities of living in the lord's manor. For this job, Bellamy interacts with the lord's subjects to soothe misgivings on new policies and sway dissenters' opinions. Officially, Bellamy is listed as the lord's entertainer (which he also does to some extent).    Bellamy views his lord highly and generally agrees with his policies, so Bellamy doesn't view the work he does as dishonest. Bellamy is a proponent of honesty and genuine social interaction, and he has a reputation as an honest man.    Bellamy is an odd character in many ways due to his philosophy on nature and beauty. As a fashionably thin half-elven man, he takes great care to keep up his appearance. He invests in a wide-ranging wardrobe and takes great care of his hair, going so far as to often paint his nails and don makeup. It is not against his nature to occasionally let his promiscuity get in the way of his duties, especially if he's been drinking. He can swing so many ways that not many people are off the table for him. Despite his flaws of apparent vanity and looseness, he sees beauty in all things and has an air of optimism about himself. While he still plays music at venues he goes to like he did when he was younger, the money he gets from his performances will usually be directed to the less fortunate. Since he enjoys writing and playing music, he views getting paid for it as a nice, but unnecessary, bonus.    Since Bellamy has been cooped up in one town for most of his life with the occasional trip to vassal states and neighboring holdings, he longs to see the world beyond his sphere that so many people have told stories of. While he's not built for adventure, he wants to record the adventures of a traveling group and accompany them so he may help them as they view appropriate."}]}

He is a half-elf sorcerer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Finarieth (Fin) Vrye. 30 years old. 5’10. Fair skin, blonde hair, brown eyes. I wear gloves almost 24/7.   My mother came from a very old, noble elf family that placed heavy restrictions on her behavior. In a fit of rebellion, she had a brief affair with my father. She realized that she wasn't cut out to live so far from her family, so she returned and gave birth to me six months later. She was generally uninvolved with my upbringing, as was standard for her family. I was always treated differently because of my human blood. The family elders refused to allow my mother to give me the family surname (Eiraval), so she gave me my father's (Vrye). Growing up, I was the family scapegoat, blamed for anything and everything that went wrong. My cousins were spoiled and cossetted; I was given perfunctory attention and was usually treated with bald hostility. The Eiraval were too good for physical violence, but it was made very clear that I was worthless and unwanted. My mother, cowed by the fear of being ousted from the family, never spoke or acted in my defense. She was a stranger to me. My grandmother, Ylien, was the worst of the bunch. She was the strongest proponent of sending me away, or, if I had to stay, treating me like a servant.   Because of her, I spent a lot of time with the various travelers who came through town— they were the lowest class and therefore, as far as she was concerned, the most appropriate company for me. I was so jealous of their freedom, and a few of them took pity on me, teaching me simple cons and tricks. One day when I was 13, a woman came through town who told fortunes and performed other minor magical feats for money. She asked if I wanted to have my fortune told, but I said no, I’d rather not know, because it couldn’t be good. Instead, I asked her how she did it. She told me about an encounter she’d had with a demonic creature— she gave it her sense of smell in exchange for her abilities. Fascinated, I wheedled the whole story out of her, including the ritual she used to do it. When I got home, I stole my cousin’s pet bird, sacrificed it, and summoned up a demon of my own. It said it would give me the power to escape my circumstances and make my own way in the world, for a price. I was ready to give it anything it asked, so when it named its price as my ability to form emotional bonds, I thought I was getting one hell of a deal. I didn’t have any emotional bonds to speak of, and I couldn’t imagine ever having any with anyone I knew, so I agreed. That night, I packed and waited. At midnight, a small vibration started in what felt like the middle of my brain. Gradually it trickled down to my hands until it grew to an unbearable itch. Thunder rolled in the distance, but I could hardly hear it. No amount of scratching helped, and by the time my palms were raw and bleeding, it crescendoed to a powerful buzz that was, finally, not painful but all-consuming. Lightning struck our house. Fires sprung up in places that the lightning hadn’t struck, and somehow the surrounding rain refused to touch it. The itching subsided. I didn’t know what part of that was my doing, but I knew I was responsible. And now more than ever, I didn’t care if anyone in the house lived or died, so I took my things and left.   I traveled far away from our home in Siar, stealing and using the tricks I’d learned to run small cons and fixed games. Eventually, I made my way to Shawnbridge, where I settled. I began a lucrative career as a burglar, starting with small residential homes and moving up to banks and jewelry stores. It’s been 15 years, and while I’m not quite a local legend, other criminals definitely know about me. I’m known only as Fin, and I don’t address my elf heritage at all, ever, with anyone. I have a solid network of contacts among other thieves, fences, smugglers, and the occasional assassin. I rarely work on contract, stealing only for myself. I use as little magic as possible, though I sometimes can’t help it. When I’m in danger, my hands itch, and I have about five minutes to figure it out myself, practically or magically, or it just bursts out of me in whatever form seems helpful. (It’s not always that helpful.) Lately, now that I’m reaching full adulthood, I’ve started to regret not being able to make friends. I’ve been in the same place for a long time now, and I have connections, but I consider no one a friend. None of my liasons have ever had a romantic component. I’ve begun to feel lonely. So when a cleric approached me and asked to enlist my skills in stealing a religious amulet, I thought that maybe that could be the key to getting back what the demon took from me. A favor from a goddess would trump a demon, right? So I agreed, violating my usual no-contract rule, and set out with the cleric.   (I don’t like the cleric, partly because he’s very rule-oriented, but mostly because he’s also a half-elf, and I have no small amount of self-loathing left over from childhood.) "}]}

His father was the 16 year old son of the well respected Lord Vancil.  This was, to put it lightly, far from ideal for everyone involved.  When his grandfather found out about Finn, he was angry and ashamed that his son could be so careless and foolish.  This was not proper behavior for a Vancil.  The grandfather, being honorable where his son was not, ensured that the kid was cared for and raised right.  He was given to a monastery for education and care.  He could never be acknowledged, for things like that were never done for halfbreeds born out of marriage, but at least he would have a life free of suffering.  The mother was paid off and Finn never saw her again.  While studying at the monastery, Finn showed promise in a number of academic areas, especially that of mathematics and language.  While he lacked any particular religious or magical leanings, he was a good study that seemed to actually enjoy learning.  He was also well known for his quick reflexes and natural athleticism, obviously taking after his family's long line of excellent swordsmen.  Finn remained at the monastery for 15 years, where he was occasionally visited by his grandfather's old friend Ebenor Solterra.  When it was time for him to leave, Solterra offered him a position with the family.  It would make use of his talents with language and understanding of the extra-natural world.  He spent a few years working on various trade ventures with foreign groups, on procuring and trading objects of religious or arcane significance, and generally helping see his family be successful.  He was rarely at the Vancil estates during this time, which is good since his father and the Lady Vancil, who had married and had a son while he was in the monastery, were never pleased to see him.  About 5 years after he started with the family, his grandfather fell ill.  Finn rushed home to see him on his death bed.  This was an unfortunate point in Finn's life.  The grandfather required Finn to promise to see that the family remain a respected and powerful house, despite his son's earnest attempts to destroy it in drunken rages and unwise investments.  Finn swore to do what he could and to keep the name strong, even though it wasn't officially his name.  Shortly after the grandfather's death, Finn was banned from the household by his father's wife.  He ended up staying with Solterra and doing what he could to support the family, but they shut him out of many of the family's dealings.  While Solterra was sympathetic, he was also the family's solicitor and thus bound by law to respect the family's wishes.  Finn resorted to more clandestine means to learn what was going on and ways to mitigate it.  Finn would often spend evenings skulking around the grounds, sneaking into the office to read correspondence, and to send messages in his father's name.  Finn managed this for a number of years.  It was not going well.  He had managed to divert several streams of correspondence and had a respectable enough trade with some arcane practitioners, he was actually able to keep the family in a positive revenue stream, barely, but they had some funds in the bank once more.  Unfortunately, his father's wife died in a horse riding accident and his father broke down completely.  He became a recluse, cut off communications and trade agreements, and slowly drank himself to death.  Finn even tried to see him, once, and was beaten severely by his father for daring to disgrace his brother by showing his face among the true and proper family.  Solterra was forbidden, by order, of telling Finn about his father's death or the actions of Finn's half-brother in liquidating all assets and fleeing across the ocean.  Of course, Finn learned that his father was dead very soon after it happened, but was unable to locate his brother until a message arrived from across the ocean.  Solterra interpreted Lord Vancil's request in a convenient way and brought Finn in to explain what had happened.  Finn was distraught.  The family name had been reduced to dirt; a name belonging to drunks and fools who can't be relied upon to stick around when things get tough.  Finn spends some time attempting to determine the nature of the agreement his brother made with the Sczarni in Magnimar and how it can be managed.  He comes to believe it is far from good and realizes these guys aren't exactly nice people when they aren't paid. When he explains all of this to Solterra, the old Solicitor decides this may be a good time to let the young man try a more active role in his life.  He provides Finn with some money and gear, in deference to the memory of his good friend and the adventures he had with Finn's grandfather.    Finn goes forth to finally take an active role in securing his promise to his grandfather.  He travels to Magnimar and meets with numerous local nobles.  His reception as a representative of House Vancil of Absalom is unexpectedly warm.  He doesn't believe the locals are actually talking about his half-brother when they describe the positive things coming from Lord Vancil in Sandpoint.  While he hasn't personally interacted with his brother in a few years, he has kept an eye on him and his activities and none of this makes much sense.  What seemed more liked his brother was the explanation of his activities with the Sczarni when they explain that the debt was given to the Sandpoint branch."}]}

Rowan thinks that she is the natural daughter of Eamon and Janna, and no one has disabused her of that belief.  In actuality, she is the product of a liaison between Eamon’s sister Leah and one of the druids of the circle in the Swamp of Darmass.  Knowing that if the truth of Rowan’s heritage was exposed she would be ostracized by the other townsfolk, Janna and Eamon decided to keep the knowledge from her for her own protection.  Those old enough to recall Leah’s running away from Mosstone and subsequent pregnant return may have an inkling that something is different about Rowan, but the only other person in the village with concrete knowledge is Father Caius, the local priest.  Rowan’s childhood began essentially the same as any other growing up in Mosstone.  Her time was split between helping with daily chores, exploring and playing in the outlying marshes of the Swamp of Darmass, and being tutored under Father Caius, the priest of Pelor.  As she grew she paid close attention to his lessons and quickly picked up the basics of how to treat those afflicted with sickness and disease.  By the time Rowan was eight, Father Caius has realized that she might be destined for more than the other children of Mosstone, and set aside extra time each week to teach her more about the tenets of Pelor.  Surprised by her affinity for healing magics, he started to allow her to accompany him about his priestly duties.  From tending the ill to distributing alms to leading services, wherever Caius went, Rowan was close behind.  The sole exception to this routine was once a week when Caius led travelers into the Swamp of Darmass, as he forbid Rowan to go with him because of the dangers.  As Rowan grew closer to the age of majority, her aptitude with the religious duties grew as well.  She became particularly adept with the blessing of the crops at the beginning of each planting season, causing a succession of hugely bountiful harvests for the village.  Many townsfolk began to view Rowan as Caius’ unofficial acolyte, knowing that it would only be a matter of time before she was formally invested into the Church of Pelor.  In addition to shadowing Caius about his daily rounds, she would spend several hours each day foraging in the marsh for medicinal plants and herbs.  One day while scouring the marsh for sundew plants, Rowan found herself further into the Swamp of Darmass than she had anticipated.  Realizing that she had gotten completely lost, she determinedly set off to find her way back to Mosstone.  After several hours of walking, Rowan recognized that she was now even more lost than before.  Though she had fixed her path by the glimpses of the sun that she caught through the thick forest canopy, knowing that it was descending to the west, she had not come out upon the marshlands.  With night quickly approaching, she decided to look for a sheltered place to rest and resolved to resume her search in the morning.  Though she could see fairly well in the murky twilight, a fatal misstep on an uneven cluster of rocks caused Rowan to fall backward and strike her head against the offending rubble, knocking her unconscious.  Rowan awoke the following morning to find a heavy weight seemingly bearing down on her legs.  Flailing about in a panic, she managed to sit up far enough to find herself face-to-muzzle with a large gray wolf.  Rapidly drawing in a breath as a preface to a shrieking fit, the realization struck Rowan that the wolf would have eaten her by now if it had meant to do so.  It was then she heard a muted chuckling coming from behind her, and she twisted around to see a male elf step from amongst the trees.  He quickly allayed her fears by explaining that he was one of the druids of the circle located within the Swamp of Darmass, and that she was in no danger from him or the wolf.  Indeed, it seemed the wolf had “chosen” her as his companion, and that such bonds were hard to sever.  Something about the elf’s nature inspired trust in Rowan and she decided to accompany him to meet the rest of the circle per his suggestion.  He mentioned that they had already sent word to Father Caius that Rowan had been found, and that she would be safe with the druids within the swamp until Caius passed through escorting the next group of travelers.  As the little party started off further into the forest he introduced himself as Aldoren, and the wolf, who stuck close to Rowan’s side, as Lyr.  After what seemed like only a few miles on foot, the dense forest suddenly gave way to a lush meadow containing concentric circles of hawthorn and ash trees, centered around an immense oak.  Gazing about nervously, Rowan heard what sounded like a faint strain of music coming from the grove of trees.  It almost sounded as if the trees were… singing?  After several minutes, Rowan realized that she was alone except for Lyr.  The faint musical sounds grew louder, as if calling to Rowan.  She and the wolf stepped forward into the trees.  All at once, time slowed to a crawl and her senses were assailed by sounds, smells, and visions.  She could hear every rustle of the leaves and every splash of the rain.  She could smell the rich, dark soil and the dry, sweet scent of wheat.  The cycle of the seasons spun on forever into the future in her mind’s eye, an endless sequence of life and death.  Just before Rowan was overwhelmed by everything, an impossibly beautiful, ageless elven woman emerged from the midst of the chaos, and spoke.  Claiming Rowan as her daughter, she decreed that Rowan would stay with the circle and learn their ways.  Trembling, Rowan could only nod her head in agreement as the figure loomed above her and disappeared, along with the rest of the sensations.  For the next four years, Rowan lived with the druids of the Order of the Verdant Grove.  Though they shared all their teachings with her, they also held themselves back.  Rowan had been touched by Melora, a thing only spoken of in the oldest of tales.  No one wanted to anger the goddess by getting too close.  The night before Rowan was to be inducted into the Order, Melora came to her again in a dream.  Rowan was to leave the druids and travel to the aid of the dwarves in Icemaul, far to the north."}]}

The three of them were once part of an adventuring group called the Tavernheads.  Raul Twelve-toes, Johnny's father, was the barbarian of the group.  Sigyl Signs, his mother, was the group's elven sorcerer, and Helga MacNamara was the gnomish cleric and the group's leader.  Along with the dragonborn psion Itz Kilstreak and the dwarven rogue Salyar Rubbletongue, the Tavernheads traveled the world fighting great evils, including the legendary lizardfolk archmage Deathscale, the ancient water dragon Nora Infinito, and a remarkably tenacious dire were-squirrel.  Helga was constantly seeking out the most dangerous missions she could find, and even after they recruited the lizardfolk ranger Alfonzina, their constant trips through vast, yet-unsettled wilderness to reach these challenges often pushed them even closer to death than the armies of skeletons.  Intra-party squabbles were frequent, and more than once once Itz and Salyar came to blows over ownership of items, and what they couldn't just leave behind for the month-long trek back to civilization.  Whenever this happened, Helga would simply withhold all healing privileges from all offending party members until the situation was resolved, usually by giving the offending item to her.  This brashness attracted Sigyl to her, and the two eventually got married in a touching ceremony marred only slightly by the momentary delay caused by an attacking dracolich.  However, one day, Helga pushed Salyar to his limit.  Enraged at having to sell off a magical bow he rarely used in order to purchase an expensive magical item to supplement Itz's powers, he stormed off to sulk in the tavern while the Tavernheads went to the Dungeon of Infernals, which is a fairly self-explanatory location.  If Salyar had been present, maybe he could have deactivated the trap that vaporised Sigyl in one blow.  Helga tried to resurrect her, but not enough was left.  She would do anything to save her.  Anything at all.  Which, of course, was exactly the point.  Of the others, Alfonzina was the first to realize what had happened, but by then it was too late.  Sigyl was waking up, confused.  Helga was standing over her, her body ensnared in a dark power.  “I saved you,” she said, “so let's hurry.”  But when she went to touch Sigyl's hand, the elven woman screamed in pain before their palms even made contact.  Sigyl still didn't understand.  But Helga did.  “This is the culmination of my power,” she said, “the culmination of my journey.  This unlimited power is my gift, and I will give it to the world.  I have always fought to protect mortalkind.  Now I will fight to uplift it.”  Then a magical bolt pierced her temple, and the window burst open, and the light shone in and devoured everything.  Salyar rescued Itz last, but when all is recorded, let it be known that he did rescue him.  Do not forget this fact.  The archmage Gaius, who had teleported there, did not have enough strength to seal off the temple, so he gave Sigyl the tools to do so, and once she had done this, she collapsed, both from the expense of far more magical energy than she thought she had in her, and under the emotional weight of what she had done.  Once they got back to town, Gaius billed them for his services — a bill which just happened to be exactly as large as the sum total of everything the party owned.   And that was the last day the Tavernheads were adventurers.  Friends they remained, but not one of them ever would become a quester again.  At least, that was the plan.  You see, five years later, Sigyl and Raul got married, moved to the vegetable farm that Sigyl's mother used to own, and had a kid.  Eight years later they had another, and eight years after that everything got massively screwed up forever.  The thing about Sigyl and Raul's first child, Patty Toes, is that she was blind from birth.  Sigyl and Raul had tried time and again to find a cleric to fix her, but you can't fix what's already broken.  Patty always insisted that she was fine — she could hear the heartbeats of animals well enough to hunt in pitch blackness as well as she could in broad daylight, which is to say as well as anyone, so really, what was all the fuss about?  Her younger brother Tommy, in fact, admired her so much that after he learned to hunt with his eyes, he put on a blindfold and had Patty teach him to hunt with his other senses.  Raul didn't approve — he knew from when he was a beginner barbarian that showing off like that could lead to self-injury — and ordered Tommy never to take napkins or handkerchiefs out into the woods during practice.  Which is when Tommy learned to steal.  Tommy admired all of his parents' old friends.  Itz had a lot of neat stories and swear words, and he taught Tommy much of the draconic tongue — especially its baudier bits, and often not deliberately.  Salyar was the only adult who understood about the thrill of subterfuge, and gave him lessons he probably shouldn't have gotten.  Alfonzina was an incredible hunter, tracker, and forager, and both he and her sister would watch enraptured as she showed them some technique or other for figuring out where such and such subspecies dire rabbit was wont to set up its warren.  And then one day his father came home from selling the season's crops at the local trading port with nothing to show for it but a strange-looking idol.  He said it was of some important goddess or other, but Tommy knew from pictures that it wasn't in her likeness at all.  He personally thought it a rather shoddy work.  Well, it was that, too.  For you see, Raul claimed that praying on it for three days and nights would give Patty her sight.  She initially declined this, but eventually relented.  But after the third night, not only could Patty not see the ornate hand-carved furniture and various oddities that her parents had painstakingly earned and collected over the years to trick themselves into thinking they still had access to the vast fortunes they once laid claims to as members of the Tavernheads, neither could anyone else.  Sigyl went to the city to ask around, but when she returned, all she could gather was that he had bought the idol from some backstreet dealer for a ridiculous sum under the impression that it could heal her daughter, and that other people with similar stories had been appearing, with the idol at the center of it all.  “Magic,” she cursed under her breath.  “I should have been able to tell.  I'm going on a walk around the tomato patch; I need to gather my thoughts.”  That was the last time the two of them saw her again.  Their will hadn't been updated for sixteen years, so the farm passed to Salyar.  He obliged out of respect for his years of camaraderie with Sigyl and Raul, but didn't know the first thing about farming, however, so despite Tommy and Patty's best efforts, boulders gathered in the fields, the soil lost its fertility, and the three basically became foragers who happened to own farm-shaped property.  Until Salyar, in the first truly generous act and most mind-bogglingly stupid decision of his life, traded the farm to a peasant-boy for all the boy had on him, which was a piece of stale bread and some tasteless wine the boy had found next to a busted-up barrel in an alleyway.  The same alleyway, in fact, though that is just a coincidence.  Now homeless, Tommy and Patty had nothing to do except track down their parents.  Which would make for a pretty exciting story of Tommy weren't such an incredible dickweed who steals for no reason, is a jerk to pretty much everyone even when it makes things inconvenient for himself, and whose incredible ability to focus on achieving his goal at any cost would be much more useful if he actually had a concrete goal beyond “find someone who's probably dead and someone who wants to remain hidden and knows exactly how we'll go about looking for her”."}]}

Knowing little of his past, he was placed in the care of the Georgio family in the city of Volos on the country of Crescent. He grew up beside his step-brother Jono, who while a few years younger was the same age relative to their lifespan differences.  At the age of 16, before he’d be considered an adult and claim his new name in Elvish tradition, he left home to practice at the Genevius Monastery. His father had recently been assassinated, and Genko felt lost in the world. He needed some form of guidance, something to believe in. Although it hurt him to leave his brother in that awful period of their life, he knew that it had to be done. He took part of his inheritance to take a carriage to a port town, and from there took a boat to the Country the Genevius Monastery was located: [insert country].  Genevius is a God of unknown shape or form, who places virtue in walking the “righteous path” that is specific to every one person. Those who found a path and followed it received Genevius’ Favor. This was an important lesson burnt into Genko’s mind by his strict, passionate teacher: Master Toji.  Master Toji was by no means a traditional teacher or a traditional Cleric. Even in a religion generally considered unorthodox, his methods of teaching and interacting with his students were considered bizarre. For one, his concept of righteousness was very different from many of the other Clerics and Monks at the Monastery. While their concept of it was one of Quixotic bravery, total selflessness, and absolute virtue, Toji’s was centered around moral relativity, utilitarianism, and a staying true to one’s beliefs. Although Genko, through his education and young adulthood, was still working out what his idea of righteousness was, the beliefs of Master Toji very heavily influenced him. Besides the talented Genko, Master Toji taught two other students alongside him. A human female named Velline, and a half-orc male named Crodsworth.  A half-orc being attempting to become a cleric in most other monasteries would likely be met with rejection, but the Genevius Church was far more accepting. Crodsworth was much more human looking than orc which certainly helped as well. Genko and Crodsworth hit it off as friends, as Crodsworth had also come from a prestigious household in Crescent, albeit on the opposite coast of Volos. His father, an alumni of the Monastery, had sent him in an attempt to teach him responsibility, virtue, and civility. Being half-orc, Crodsworth often felt at war with himself, often getting violent urges. He was almost kicked out after beating his previous teacher to a bloody pulp. It was only with the incessant protesting of Master Toji that kept him in with the promise to take him on as his own student. The one time Crodsworth had lost his tempter with Toji and charged at him, Master Toji used his own force against Crodsworth, who found himself flipped onto his back with a foot on his chest. Then, the hand of the compassionate Toji extended to help him up. He was not chastised, nor was the occurrence ever mentioned to any other members of the faculty. After that, the two worked heavily on learning to accept the duality of himself, and Crodsworth never had a violent incident after that. He learned to control his feelings, and also to utilize them in his sparring matches with Genko. The two ended up sharing a dorm together in their last two years at the monastery, and developed a brotherly sort of bond. Genko saw a bit of Jono within Crodsworth, and perhaps that’s why they got along so well.  Genko could not say that his relationship with Velline was as positive as his with Crodsworth. He could not deny her talent, but he found her pretension and snobbery obnoxious. She often argued with Master Toji, and frequently questioned his methods.While Master Toji always respected the questioning of authority, even he was tired by her obsession with semantics. She was intelligent, fierce, determined, and kind of a bitch. Genko respected her, but he by no means liked her. Velline didn’t do either for Genko.  However, many of the highest ranking members of the Monastery had different ideas of what the “righteous path” meant. The doctrine of the Monastery was altered, with its focus no longer being to prepare its members to find their path and set off on it, but to instead make its members place all of their efforts into expanding and benefiting the church, even collecting Indulgences allegedly granting Genevius’ Favor.  Instead of Genevian Clerics and Monks, they began to send out simple missionaries repeating pre-rehearsed phrases that greatly differed from what original Genevians taught. The Monastery being their own home, many of the followers chose to simply accept this change instead of creating a schism and losing the only thing they had. They even eventually came to believe these new teachings. The first to speak out against this was Genko’s Master. He did not present his beliefs to the Grand Cleric, but instead posted a collection of essays upon the door of the Council Hall, and left during the night without a word, with the exception of a letter for each of his three students.  Genko’s read:  “Genko,  I’ve already left. I by no means encourage you to follow. This is my path. You must find yours.  ~Toji\"  Genko became disillusioned by the Monastery after his favorite and most trusted teacher was expelled from it on grounds of Heresy for calling out this greed-driven sacrilege. He had learned the essential skills of a Cleric, and although he knew he would be labeled a Heretic and cast out from the Monastery, he spoke out against the Grand Cleric. In spite of the advice of his teacher, he decided leaving was the righteous path for him. After studying the essays the church had attempted to remove all trace of, he found he could no longer stay at the monastery without abandoning his ideals of righteousness.  Of Toji’s students, two left the monastery as heretics. Genko, and a while later Crodsworth. Crodsworth found the change in direction for the sake of greed and expansion disgusting. Although he was in control of his urges at this time, he lost control at one integral moment. He was passing by some high ranking Clerics when he heard them talking about the sacrilege of Master Toji. He was painted as someone evil, who stood against everything the Monastery meant. Genko and Crodsworth had discussed whether what Toji said about the monastery was true before, and had both become disgusted by the thought of continuing their relationship with the organization. Crodsworth felt his blood boil, and he beat the Cleric to a bloody pulp with his bare hands before fleeing. He knew he could never return to his father after this, so he left to start a new life with his skills. He assumed Genko would return to Volos, but he figured he would take on a new identity as the two were both aware of how the Monastery treated heretics. Crodsworth decided to do the same, and it seemed at that time that the two friends would never meet again. Crodsworth adopted the name Bento Borneo and set off towards the southern coast of Crescent.  Velline continued her work as a missionary, finding the money good and the housing stable. She eventually rose up to be a high ranking member of the Monastery. Genko was pleased to be relinquished of her company.  After losing status in the organization and being expelled from all of the Monastery’s few other locations, he returned to Crescent and his childhood home at the age of 20. He gave himself the new name Craros Nyoho to both grant himself some anonymity from the Religion’s new sect of Zealots that set out to silence those who left the Organization, as well as in Elvish tradition when one reaches adulthood. Craros wondered about the fate of Toji and Crodsworth. They would likely do the same in taking a new identity and going into hiding. Toji himself had kept his past secret, and his students didn’t even know where his hometown was. The only thing Craros had learned about his past was hearing Toji talking to another Cleric in passing, where he heard Toji say, “[mumble mumble] back in Red Swork we used to [mumble mumble]”. All Craros knew about Red Swork at the time was that it was a city even bigger and more populated than Volos. Finding a specific person there would be like finding an honest man in a crowd, which is an expression Master Toji had often used.  Upon reaching the Georgio family, he finds that his brother Jono has long since left. Townsfolk who knew him claim he had left to pursue mercenary work, but had become rotten to the core years ago and joined a local, enigmatic gang. Craros searched for some time to find his brother, with no luck. He kept himself hidden, as he knew Volos was the first place the Zealots would search. Slowly, but surely, he gathered information on the Patricia family that Jono had joined. They were a powerful group that essentially ruled the city. He knew it was a hopeless lead, however, as even if he were to interrogate one of the members they would never reveal any information on Jono, not that he would ever resort to torture.  All he had been able to learn was that he had recently left the organization, in spite of having become a powerful member at such a young age. The only hint he’d received was by a close confidant of Jono, a member of the gang he ran with who went by the name Abato. Although he did not know where Jono was, as Volos was a large city, he did believe Craros when he said he was was Jono’s brother as Jono had told them about his family before. All that Abato could tell Craros was about an organization named Violet, which was the group who killed their father, and a man who went by the pseudonym Sapphire. Sapphire was the boss of Violet, and the one who orchestrated the murder of Alexi Georgio. He was a man with blue hair and a robotic left forearm. That was the only thing they were ever able to uncover.  Craros lived on the streets of Volos for a while. His family’s home had been demolished, and he found little hospitality elsewhere. He spent his time scouring for information about Sapphire, hoping it would reunite him with his brother. The only responses he received were people not knowing what he was talking about, or people attacking him as soon as the name Sapphire was spoken. One night, close to the end of the year, he was walking to his temporary residence at an inn past a local bar, only to bump into a man coming out of said bar. The man looked aggravated, and Craros was cautious. He looked at the man’s face, and saw the eyes of someone who had seen much violence and grief, someone who was lost and searching for something out of his reach. But beneath all that, he saw the unmistakable jovial cheeriness of his brother.  Craros laughed, hard. All this time he had spent searching for his brother, hoping for a cathartic reunion, and he just happened to bump into him outside of a bar. Over the past few weeks, he had frequently questioned whether or not he was on the right path, whether Genevius would approve. He almost even gave up hope and resigned to the fact that he would never find his brother or he might even be dead. And now, being questioned by his brother about what was so funny, he knew that he’d been walking the right path all along. He pulled down his hood, spoke to Jono his old name of Genko Georgio for the first time in so long, and was immediately pulled in for a long, powerful hug.  They caught each other up on all of the events of the past few years. Jono told Craros of his life as an officer in the Patricia family, and Craros told him of his expulsion from the Monastery and his new label as a Heretic. They had both been searching after Sapphire, though for Jono is was vengeance and Craros it was to find his brother. Craros was sad to see his home in such disarray, and the two slowly started to weed out the more notorious criminals. They were searching for Sapphire or any clues to find him, yet in their actions became seen as unknown heroes of Volos. They embraced the mythos behind this unforeseen fame, and donned reflective masks while they worked.  Soon, the city had reached record low levels of crime, and it was prospering and beautiful once again. Even the Patricia family, although largely untouched by the so-called Twilight Knights (besides some low level thugs that had disobeyed orders and acted against Patricia family code), had pulled back on their less than ethical operations. Perhaps it was out of fear that the Twilight Knights would retaliate, or perhaps it was out of respect.Jono’s gang never officially learned that Jono was a Twilight Knight, but they recognized that the mark on society the Twilight Knights left was something only someone as inspired as Jono could accomplish.  Feeling their job was done, and still with no leads on Sapphire, they head towards the capital of Crescent, known by many for its iconic gigantic red sword and by others for its propensity of guiding people towards their fates. They don’t know what they’ll find there, but they know it will be significant.  Craros still finds himself clueless as to what the “Righteous Path” he should follow is, yet he knows the only way to find it is to travel the realms and act in an order he himself would consider righteous. He believes doing this, despite whatever treachery or danger that may come to them, will certainly lead him to the true path he must follow and let him attain Genevius’ Favor along the way."}]}

Their control of the region’s rich platinum veins along with a tight grip on the local government had led to quite the accumulated fortune over the years. As of Varik’s birth the mines had been stripped clean for decades, but the Edelsteins saw no reason to relinquish their accustomed lifestyle and status at the top of their provincial heap. Their sprawling manor dominated Glimcrag’s town center, with its splendor waning with age as the Edelsteins kept a progressively tighter grip on their remaining wealth. Realistically, most things in Glimcrag were on the decline. While far from a ghost town yet, Glimcrag’s infrastructure was also showing signs of neglect as tax income diminished, with many structures now lying unused. Many families were clinging to their land and property, farmers in particular, and there was still money in catering to travelers and caravaneers, but no one would describe the streets as “bustling” anymore. The Edelsteins themselves tended to keep to their bubble of relative wealth and rarely mixed with the greater populace.  Varik’s mother was Louenna Edelstein, the beautiful daughter of the Edelstein patriarch currently holding the Glimcrag’s mayorship. She was known as a free spirit, mercurial and moody, and was a popular topic of gossip thanks to her flirtatious nature and torrid romances that began and ended abruptly. She was also the subject of an old family superstition, regarding a curse on the family’s progeny. That every four generations the female Edelstein heirs would only birth cursed children, weak and deformed. If asked, those within the family would spout their version of a tale regarding a hag angered centuries ago. Those outside the family liked chalking the “curse” up to a family history of marrying within a narrow pool. Whatever the truth, Louenna was discouraged from seeking marriage and especially from seeking motherhood. Louenna’s capriciousness was enough to make marriage unlikely on its own. Despite this factor, it was well known that she greatly desired to raise a child, and many suspected this desire stemmed from feeling denied the option.  Thus, when Louenna dallied with a wood elf trader and conceived a child, many presumed it was to thwart the curse’s terms. After all, a half-blood illegitimate child would certainly not be considered an Edelstein.  The father vanished the day the pregnancy became known, and there was a minor scandal, particularly since an unlanded trader was considered of low social status. This bounced off Louenna for the most part, who insisted on bringing the child to term. Even considering the scandal her father had no real desire to disown her, and so Louenna retained her place in the manor, Varik was born, and the family eventually moved on to the next scandal. Despite his absence, Louenna bestowed Varik with his father’s Elvish surname of Yhendhorn. With the Edelstein’s lukewarm reception of the child, she likely saw no reason to fight to attach her own surname.  As for the curse, whether supernatural or a fluke of nature, the newborn Varik did not escape it. He was indeed born with deformities, most notably his misshapen legs and a preternaturally frail constitution. His odds of survival were considered low, but Louenna insisted he be well cared for. The sickly child persisted. He was plagued with breathing difficulties, a weak stomach, and a tendency to tire easy, none of which improved as he grew older. Varik did learn to walk, but only with the aid of a walking stick as his own legs could not support himself properly. He also had a way of catching contagious illnesses at the drop of a hat and was slow to recover. Louenna ached at seeing her son suffer, and when possible used what access she had to the family fortune to hire clerics and other healers. They would ease his symptoms and even cure him of any contagious disease he suffered, but his underlying condition never improved. Louenna chalked this up to the curse, but as attempts at curse removal also failed, the healers were more commonly of the opinion that you could not cure someone of the circumstances of their birth.  Varik’s family was largely indifferent to his presence within the manor and considered him Louenna’s problem. While even as a bastard child, he had some social obligation to them, their treatment tended to be icy and distant. His mother was of course the exception to this, always doting on him and hating to let him out of her sight for long. Young Varik came to prefer solitude and developed a dim view of his various cousins, aunts, and uncles, with “twit” being the word he would use to describe the majority. His mother oversaw his care, but as time grew on he became less and less tolerant of even her presence. Both of them had a stubborn streak and rarely had breathing room from from each other. Varik’s frustration with her constant attention and control festered and manifested in attempts to assert his independence: performing strenuous tasks without her aid, refusing the latest expensive treatment she purchased, venturing out on his own with no warning, etc. These protests usually backfired and would only lead to tearful reprimands from Louenna, who would then keep an even sharper eye on him. She also would worry about his reclusive nature and engage in heavy-handed attempts to help him make friends. The occasional forced play dates were awkward, with Varik having little in common with children his age. This habit of hers became far worse as he entered his teens and she transitioned to introducing him to “nice girls.” This went about as well as one would expect. Throughout all this, a constant point of contention was Louenna’s continued habit of acquiring and dropping beaus and the associated uncomfortable introductions.  While Varik’s family life was always rocky, a comforting constant for him was his love of the written word. He learned to read before he learned to walk, and outpaced his tutors by the time he was a preteen. He also showed a knack for scribing with pen and ink. Despite Varik’s tepid relationship with the greater Edelstein family, he was often called upon when someone needed a letter or other document drafted in a hurry. When Varik was well enough to venture from the manor, he was commonly found in the town’s library. The shabby collection of dated tomes had been languishing for some decades thanks to poor funding and reduced demand for its services. Despite the place’s poor condition, Varik felt at ease amongst the cobwebby stacks and would wile away hours there, until his mother came looking for him or the dusty air forced him to leave prematurely. He read whatever he could get his hands on, even teaching himself Elven, Gnomish, and Dwarfish to partake of the more exotic texts when he ran out of books in Common. While he read indiscriminately, he particularly reveled in escapism, anything that gave him a taste of the world beyond his own dull corner of Faerun, whether it be tales of high adventure or detailed geographic texts.  Shortly before Varik’s nineteenth birthday, the woman who had maintained the library passed of old age, leaving the aging building’s fate uncertain. To the surprise of his greater family and the protest of his mother, Varik volunteered to take over as librarian. While it was questioned he was qualified, no one else was terribly interested. Apathy saw the position handed to Varik. Besides, if an elderly woman managed the place by herself, maybe a crippled half-elf could.  Varik was also uncertain he was qualified, but was motivated by an emotional attachment to the collection. Besides, it was an excuse to spend more time away from the manor. While technically an adult now, his health was not improving and his prospects for an independent life without his mother were looking slim. He gave the task his all, feeling that if he should make the most of his state of being stuck in Glimcrag. The library’s disuse worked in his favor and he was able to manage, keeping the place organized and assisting the occasional visitors. To his surprise there was still a small trickle of tax money dedicated to the library, which he was eager to spend on fresh books. Instead he found this coin was readily eaten up by his need to hire assistance with the heavier labor, especially since he couldn’t bring himself to accept his mother’s repeated attempts to assist for free.   So, his desire for some fresh reading material motivated Varik to bolster his funds by offering teaching and tutoring services when he could. He wasn’t even sure there was demand for it, given Glimcrag’s state of decline. But, a surprising number of families were willing to scrape a little silver together, likely hoping literate children would have more chances to leave town and succeed elsewhere. Even he was surprised to find he had a particular knack for teaching and genuinely enjoyed assisting those who wanted to learn. And with his health, he had a ready supply of excuses to refuse service to problematic clients. He could never take many students at a time, but it was enough to ensure a trickle of fresh material coming to the library.  Life continued thus for Varik for roughly a decade: he continued to teach and do what he could to improve what he now considered his library, family continued to ignore him for the most part, and both his health and relationship with his mother continued on their rocky course. He took pride in his work and what independence he had achieved, but a feeling of dissatisfaction and sheer boredom continued to nag him. He couldn’t quash a sensation of being trapped and often fantasized about setting on his own and leaving Glimcrag behind. It was at these times when he least questioned the existence of a curse, for whenever he seriously considered risking travel, his health would take a downward turn and push it out of his reach again.  Not long after he turned twenty-nine, events were set into motion that drastically altered the course of Varik’s life. It started with an older woman approaching him in his library with an aged tome for sale. A merchant stopping by was not unusual in and of itself: regulars at the local market would direct traders with books to Varik as a potential buyer. What was strange was her bothering to come by with just a single book asking for a piddling five silver, less than he would expect to pay even for cheap pulp. Odder still was that she seemed a little addled and strangely desperate to make the sale. As soon as he showed any interest and inquired about the nature of the book, she snatched the silver from his hand and hurried out. He was left with the large tome resting on his desk, feeling more confused than upset. Inspecting it, he found its dark violet cover devoid of marking and of strange material, wrinkled and clearly organic, fleshy and almost oily to the touch. Curious, he tried to open it, but found it stubbornly refused to give way. He had been the target of scams before and figured this was another, but was befuddled that she would go through the trouble and ask for only five silver. Dropping it in a drawer and going about his business, he found his thoughts fixating on it through the day. And so, he took it home and set it at his bedside with the intent of inspecting it further. Instead he fell asleep early, and he dreamt.  What Varik experienced that night was intense and unearthly, a dream more vivid and lucid than anything he had ever experienced. It began with confusing visions of an otherworldly realm. Varik was acquainted with hallucinogens thanks to past treatments for his conditions, but the experience was bizarre beyond what his own mind had ever produced. Despite the dream’s vividness Varik finds it hard to recall the particulars of what he saw, but he was left with impressions: thick syrupy air, myriad eyes, amorphous structures disregarding gravity, sprawling tendrils of flesh.  These visions persisted for what felt like years, though rationality periodically bubbled through the dreaming haze and remind him that was impossible. The landscapes slowly gave way to void, and after a seemingly interminable span the void gave way to an enormous creature. Varik’s head and senses began to clear as he took in the being before him, a fluid assemblage of tendrils and shifting, intelligent eyes, staring intent. They regarded each other for an indeterminate period, Varik knowing he should be terrified while feeling incongruously calm.   After a time, the thing spoke, and its voice washed over Varik in a layered stream of nonsense gibbers as it beckoned with its limbs. While Varik distinguished no words, ideas crystallized in his mind. He felt an offer of boons: unearthly power, freedom from bonds, a sense of wholeness. He also sensed a desire for an exchange, for him to be take a new bond and purpose. Intrigued, Varik tried to speak in return, but this only made the vague messages more emphatic. There was no menace to the exchange, only insistence and the strange calm that continued to wash over Varik. Though certain he was dreaming, he couldn’t shake a sense that what was happening was also deeply real. He listened and watched the creature beckon, and he thought. As he thought he became more and more convinced that his thing was in fact offering him a new life, strange as that was, and he couldn’t deny how much he desired such. That isn’t to say the rational part of Varik’s mind wasn’t also reminding him that he should be terrified and that he was crazy to be considering this. But, on a deeper level, he simply didn’t care that it was crazy and sensed this was his only chance at… something big, he wasn’t sure quite what, but something truly life-changing for once. He reached for the closest proffered appendage and grasped it. At this, he abruptly jerked to consciousness, the vast creature giving way to his dimly moonlit bedroom.  The calm that had been suffusing Varik gave way immediately to a barrage of emotion, with fear at the forefront as his waking mind rapidly processed what he had just seen. Sweating and shaky in his bed, he slowed his breathing and worked on convincing himself it had been a nightmare. As he did so, he realized that something felt wrong, yet… more right than usual? His breath came far too easily, many aches and pains had vanished, his legs did not feel like his own, and most strangely, something in his very mind felt different, like a new muscle. Lighting a candle, he hesitantly inspected himself and found his deformities gone, and that he could stand up and walk completely naturally, as if he had always been able to.  Varik left Glimcrag before dawn and set for Neverwinter, stealing a horse and a few supplies from the manor under cover of night first. He took the tome with him too, sensing its importance. He regretted leaving so abruptly, abandoning all his work at the library, but also felt little desire to explain anything to his family. He knew his mother would be devastated by his disappearance, but any guilt was overridden by a certainty that she would not make it easy for him to leave. His trip to Neverwinter was harrowing, not due to any true danger, but more due to having never ridden a horse or fended for himself before. Eventually he made it, rattled and saddle sore, but with enough money to rent a room at the inn.  Several weeks passed for Varik in Neverwinter. It didn’t take him long to realize that he had acquired more than a stronger constitution. First he found that he could speak without words, though his first accidental use of that ability taught him to be mindful of his stray thoughts. He also found that there was much more to the tome, which now opened to his touch. It did not contain any language he was familiar with, but after a brief study of its pages he felt an intuitive knowledge of how to tap into and manipulate a reservoir of arcane energy now within himself. He soon mastered his first spells and noted that they seemed a little… different from the standard fare of apprentice wizards.  Varik spent most of his time seeking to understand what had happened to him, selling the horse to sustain his research. He felt no small amount of fear that there had to be a cost attached to what was gained, recalling the creature had beckoned for an exchange. After that encounter his sleep had been frequently disturbed by similar unearthly visions, but they unfortunately provided no clarification. He scoured Neverwinter’s library, much larger than his own had been, studying tomes about magic, deities, and the planes in hopes of learning the nature of the being he had bargained with. He found no mention of anything like what he had seen. What he did find were accounts of other bargains for arcane magic, usually referred to as pacts. Such stories inevitably ended badly for the pactmaker, with a Devil acquiring their soul or a Fey lady abducting a firstborn. While these stories offered little insight, they made him uneasy, and he worried he had done something that was at best taboo and at worst extremely dangerous.  Varik’s time in Neverwinter came to an end when he caught wind of a reward being offered for the whereabouts of a crippled half-elf matching his description. While his improved condition greatly reduced the chance of someone making the connection, Varik took this as his cue to leave town, feeling his research had hit a dead end. A demonstration of the destructive bolts his magic could produce easily netted him a job guarding a caravan to Phandelver. He figured the pay would be adequate to find transport further south, perhaps to Baldur’s Gate. His destiny proved much more complex after goblins attacked the caravan and he and his fellow guards found themselves embroiled in events in Phandelver."}]}

He is a Sorcerer and belongs to the Half-Elf race."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From his birth Francis lived as a servant to Lord Archibald Embercrumb and Lady Edwina Embercrumb, in the grand Embercrumb Manor situated in the upper class district of the city of Eaglestone. Eaglestone, which has long acted as a city of magical advancement, is a home to some of the greatest families of Wizards in history, and the Embercrumb family is no exception. Lord Archibald Embercrumb is famous throughout Eaglestone, and the surrounding areas, for his personal contributions to advancing the arcane arts, as well as for his blood lines excellent mastery of Pyro magics. Francis, at the time named Dribble, greatly admired Lord Archibald for his history, but he admired him even more for his character, while he hated to think of it, Dribble was of mixed blood, \"the product of a moment of animal lust between a human and lowly elf woman\" Lady Edwina would always say. This was always a source of shame for him, as such he has always kept his hair long enough to cover his long ears. His mixed blood made Dribble an outsider in Eaglestone, which was mostly populated by humans, spare for the odd elf slave owned by the more affluent families. Despite this Lord Archibald had always shown Dribble a level of respect and consideration that he rarely saw from anyone else in the city, this came as a stark comparison to Lady Edwina, who showed now restraint in proclaiming her distaste for other \"lesser\" races.   Because of this Dribble had always been confused as to why Lady Edwina kept him present in the manor as her servant. No matter how hard he tried, she could find fault in everything he did, he would spend hours cleaning the kitchen but she would still find a speck of dirt to scold him over. At times it felt as though this transcended her mere animosity for elves, and became a focused resentment toward him, although he couldn't think of what he had done to deserve this. He once asked Lord Archibald why she harboured this loathing for him and the Lord merely scoffed, stating \"as with many women who marry for fame and fortune, they grow into venomous hags in later life\". While this did slightly ease Dribbles concern he also felt sad for the Lord and Lady, while he rarely became involved in personal conversations with either of them, he knew they would be wed for 45 years in the coming months, surely not all relationships were doomed to failure? Dribble suspected that this divide between the Lord and Lady could be linked to the loss of their son, Francis. Whenever distant relatives would travel to the manor, conversation would often turn to this \"lost son of Embercrumb\". No one ever specified what \"lost\" meant but the fact that the Lord and Lady never spoke of their son made Dribble believe he was likely dead, what other explanation could there be?   While questions of the lost son of Embercrumb and Lady Edwina's almost unreasonable disgust for him bemused Dribble, there was another question that filled his thoughts even more as he aged, who were his parents? The question would nag in the back of his mind each day, so much so that he felt compelled to confront the Lord and Lady on the matter of how he came to be in their service, Lady Edwina was noticeably rattled by the question but before she could mount an answer Lord Archibold spoke, \"My boy, we know very little regarding your parents, while out in the city one day we found you abandoned and concerned for your life we brought you back here. We tried to find any trace of who your parents may be and contacted the local authorities, but we received no comforting response. As such we felt you would be better here with us than growing up in an orphanage.\" He still recalls how hearing those words made his heart feel like it was sinking down through his body, and witnessing the slowly collapsing relationship between the Lord and Lady did little to raise his spirits. Did his parents grow to hate each other and leave Dribble in Eagleston as they didn't want a reminder of each other? Or was Lady Edwina right, had they simply been two lovers passing in the night, never giving thought to what their passion could bring? When he was younger these thoughts deflated Dribble, but as he grew older his strict and cold upbringing had instilled and early maturity in him. He had now accepted his lot in life, and could at least take comfort in the fact that unlike some men and women in the world he had a roof over his head and hot food to fill his belly, at least it was hot when Lady Edwina granted him enough oil to cook himself a warm meal. Despite his acceptance of his circumstances though, it didn't stop him pondering on the matter.   Time passed quickly in the manor, a regular schedule of collecting groceries and cleaning were the main roles Dribble was trusted with. Shortly after turning 15 he was asked to assist the head cook of the manor in the Kitchen, this quickly ended however as one day when working with the hob it erupted with an overwhelming flame that singed the ceiling and the hairs of the head cook, Mr. Rumpletilt. Dribble was knocked back from the sheer force of the blast, and was so shaken that he didn't notice being dragged upstairs my Mr Rumpletilt and being berated by Lady Edwina, before being sent to bed with no supper. That night he lay in bed thinking of what had happened, he recalled the words of Mr Rumpletilt, \"The damn boy must've put too much coal and kindling in before lightning the hob, we're all bloomin lucky he didn't blow the manor sky high\", but that couldn't have been what happened ... Dribble had put in the least amount of coal need and only just lit the match for the hob, or had he overloaded it and not noticed? He didn't waste long on these thoughts though, as a week later he heard the only news that make his sad little existence seem worse, through the almost incoherent blubbering of Lady Edwina Dribble understood that Lord Archibald Embercrumb, the head of this house, did not have long to live. While Dribble knew the Lord was much older than the lady, he never asked by how much, and while he noticed a slow but steady decline in how active the Lord was never thought this would happen. As the words sank into him he was reminded of that day he asked about his parents, and felt that same sinking feeling that he hoped never to feel again.   Over the next month Dribble blankly continued his tasks around the manor, each day different doctors would visit, but they would always leave in the same way, standing by the door shaking their head with Lady Edwina holding her head in her hands. As his final days grew closer the Lord requested a strangely greater number of visits from little Dribble, he would speak to him for hours about his journeys in his youth, the places he went to and the people he met, each time he would end the story saying, \"One day my boy, I hope you will do the same.\" The only thing Dribble hoped for, was that the Lord wouldn't leave him. Sadly though, on a stormy night a few weeks later, Lord Archibald summoned Dribble to his bed side for one last time, as he entered the room Lady Edwina was there as well as some of the other men and women who worked in the manor, there was also a strange man in a black suit who Dribble recognised from visiting the manor before. When he first saw him he thought he must be a doctor, however after Dribble arrived he produced some documents which he quickly began to read. It was now obvious that he was in fact lawyer here to read the Lords will. He spoke with a cold and sharp voice, clearly showing his experience in such events, \"I Lord Archibald Embercrumb, of sounds mind and body, hereby leave all my monetary assets, including my manor in Eaglestone to my wife, Lady Edwina Embercrumb\" upon hearing the words the Lady collapsed blubbering again, Dribble knew this was as to be expected, who else would he leave his great wealth to? However strangely the man continued, \"However, should my son ever return to the manor, all assets will instantly go to him, including ownership of the manor and any wealth still remaining after my wife has had access to it. That is all.\" There was a brief and awkward pause, Lady Edwina's blubbering halted immediately and turned to something closer to rage, \"What do you mean 'all assets will go to him!?\" she cried. The lawyer calmly looked at her with his cold almost lifeless eyes, \"As it says, should your son ever return the manor will belong to him, the Lord wished for the house to remain with his bloodline if it can, as it has done for generations.\" Following Lady Edwina's outburst, Lord Embercrumb had raised himself in his bed and looked upon those around in him his final moments, \"Do you have a problem with this my dear?\" he said in a commanding voice. \"...No, not at all my love, I was just surprised as we never discussed this\", the Lady sheepishly replied, \"No I suppose we did not, now all of you leave me.\" and with that Lord Archibald slowly sank back in to the soft silk bed linens covering him, \"Except for you Dribble, you stay.\" Dribble felt an overwhelming mix of emotions, from sadness over the situation to joy that he would get to speak to his Lord one last time.   The men and women slowly stepped out of the bedroom, all the while Dribble could feel the harsh glare of Lady Edwina on him, he didn't know why the Lord wanted to speak to him alone but he was sure it wouldn't do him any favours tomorrow, when the Lady would be his only master, but for now he would enjoy this moment. The only source of light in the room was a flickering candle on the Lords bed side table, and as Dribble slid a stool closer to Archibald, the light revealed a man he barely recognised, the frail and withered man lying in front of him barely resembled the great man he spent so much time with just months before, it was a harsh reminder that no man can escape time. \"My Lord, I am grateful you would want to speak with me and allow me a chance to say goodbye, but surely you would want to spend this time with your wife, Lady Edwina?\" Dribble said, Archibald softened his demeanor and smiled, \"You have always thought of others boy, I would like to say you got it from my side of the family but considering the Embercrumb family history it must be from your mother...\" he coughed lightly as the words left his mouth. Dribble smiled, but as the words slowly sank into him the smile changed into a look that could only be described as bemused, \"I am sorry Lord, but your side of the family? You must be feeling much worse than the others thought, as it sounds like you're suggesting I am part of the Embercrumb family.\" Lord Archibald's face turned very serious, \"Did it now? Well I suppose that would be because that it is the truth.\" Again this bizarre serious of words only made Dribble feel confused, \"My Lord you are not making any sense, let me fetch the doctor for\", \"Sit down and listen lad, I don't have much time left as I am sure you can tell. Now over there by the fire place there is an old oak chest with brass fittings, you're still young so bring it here could you?\" As always Dribble, did not hesitate to do as his master ordered, he did not know how to act between his sense of confusion, sorrow and guilt that the Lord was clearly so deranged and he could do nothing.   He slowly dragged the chest near the bed and sat back down on his stool, Lord Archibald pushed himself up to be sitting to get a good view of the chest in the dimly lit room. \"Excellent, thank you my boy, now here please open the chest\" he slowly slid his hand into the top buttons of night gown around his neck, and as the hand retracted it was holding a key tied to a chain around his neck. He slipped the chain and key over his head and passed it to Dribble, \"My Lord I am not sure why you want me to do this..\", \"All will become clear once you open the chest.\" And so Dribble took the key to the chest but now found something even more confusing, \"My Lord, I am sorry, but this chest has no lock on it ... I don't know how to open it.\" A wry smile slowly stretched across Archibald's face, \"well of course it has no lock, it's a magic chest, enchanted so that only a son of the Embercrumb family can open it.\" There he went again, suggesting that Dribble, a lowly half elf, was a son of the great Embercrumb family, \"My Lord please, lay down and rest you're making yourself worse\", \"Worse!? I have not felt this happy in years, happy and ashamed, you see you may not believe it, but you are my Grandson and you will open that chest!\" \"But how?\" Dribble replied, tears beginning to well in his eyes over the stress of the situation, \"By using magic, your magic, the same magic you used when you caused that accident in the kitchen a few months ago.\" Upon hearing those words Dribble's whole body went cold, an icy chill spread from his head down to his toes, was this true? Did he use magic to cause that accident? His head was rapidly filling with questions but Archibald was urging him on to open the chest and he didn't want to disappoint him. He turned and leant down towards the chest, \"I still don't understand, how should I open it if there is no lock?\", \"Relax and it should become clear\" Lord Archibald replied in a reassuring tone, and so, Dribble calmed himself and looked toward the chest, hoping for something, anything to happen and then suddenly something did.   A strange shimmer began to distort the space near the front of the chest, it warped and twisted the contact between the lid and base making distinction between the two impossible, and just as quickly as the warping began it started to reverse, now with a silver glow at the centre. As the chest began to look normal again Dribble recognised what looked like a lock proudly emerging at the front. He stared in amazement, obviously living in Eaglestone Dribble has seen magic before, but never this close, and never anything so mesmerising. Archibald already knew that Dribble had witnessed the chests transformation, \"Well go on my boy, open it\" he said with a faint sense of glee. Dribble held out the key between his fingers with its head facing the lock, his hand began to shake as he slid the key into the hollow space at the locks centre and just as the key was fully submerged. the chest suddenly swung open with incredible force. Inside it revealed many large books which had clearly been read multiple times, a tattered robe and cloak and an envelope bearing the wax seal of the Embercrumb family, a beautiful phoenix bathed in flames. The envelope had a name written on it, 'To Francis', it said, a name Dribble did not need help remembering, \"My Lord is this letter for your lost son?\", Archibald smiled and replied, \"No my boy, this letter is for my Grandson, and that is his true name although he has not used it since birth. My Grandson, a half human, half-elf, who has lived long enough to know the truth. That letter is for you, Francis.\" At a time like this you would imagine a wave of mixed emotions washing over you, for Dribble, now Francis, the truth was he felt nothing. It was as if the overwhelming situation had caused a block in him, he couldn't even comprehend the words Archibald had said, he just knelt staring at the letter sitting atop all other contents of the chest. He felt an urge inside him, drawing him to that letter, it was as if the moment he saw it he knew, he knew it was meant for him, and so slowly and carefully he picked it up and began to break its seal.   As Francis lifted open the envelope and removed the letter inside Lord Archibald could only sit and watch in silence, he wanted to say something, anything, but he knew that letter would explain the situation far better than he could now. And so he waited as Francis unfolded the paper he now held and began to read it, a letter from father to son.   'To my dear Francis,   If you are reading this then I am so very sorry, sorry that I was not with you to explain all of this in person. I had hoped that I would have returned by now, but where I am heading and what I am doing doesn't allow for an accurate guess at when I may return. As I am sure your Grandfather, my father, has now explained, you are indeed the youngest son of the Embercrumb family, the latest in a long line of powerful wizards. I hope you can one day find it in your heart to forgive me and your Grandparents for keeping this from you since your birth, for now I cannot explain why we did this, but please understand that it was for your own protection. I hope that one day you and I can meet so that I may explain to you in person why I had to leave, and why I had to keep your identity a secret even from you, if you are reading this letter though the time has come for you to begin learning how to master the magic that is in your blood. I know you have no reason to do as I ask, but as your father I implore you to heed my directions, as soon as you are able you must travel far east to visit an old wizard named Cornelius Zumbrage, he taught me magic and studied with your Grandfather when they were younger. He is a man unlike anything you have experienced before, but know he is at his core a kind and generous man. The times ahead may be hard but take comfort in the knowledge that your mother and I loved your dearly and did not want this life for you, I am sure you have many questions about who and where she is but the sad truth is that your mother passed away when you were born. Her name was Gloria Thinderween, I wish you could have known her, she was the most gentle and beautiful creature that has ever existed and as I write this letter the pain of losing her is almost too much to bare. The only thing keeping me moving now is the thought that you will grow up safe and I may one day see you again.   Please stay safe my son, seek out Cornelius as soon as you can and trust no-one until you speak with him.   Your Father,   Francis Embercrumb, the First.'"}]}

Fate made her parents paths cross under circumstances Rivinka is not fully aware; all she knows is that, for a while, her mother's tribe and father's adventuring party shared a common goal, and perhaps a common enemy. After that, Urthaga and Dmitri retired to a quiet tower near the village of Riverrun, where she was born and raised.  Since her youth, Rivinka had strange, dark magic, very different than that of her father; she enjoyed an affinity to shadows, and could hear whispers of the dead, being herself not quite alive for hours at a time. What caused her shadow sorcery to manifest is unknown, and it made her grow up isolated and unconnected to the world around her, as father and mother were her only company - until later in life, when she had learned to control her magic, being in cities and around large gatherings of the living made her sick.  She learned as much as she could from her parents, and despite the oddities was a capable, well-educated, intelligent and polite girl.

He gave her his cape and hat, as well as money, equipment, and a daunting task: to find her mother, wherever she may be.  He told her that letting her mother go had been a mistake, and that he needed Riv to find her and reunite the family, as he was too old and frail to go search for her himself. Stating that there was no time to lose, he hugged her, wished her luck, made her promise she would come back with her mother, and then zapped her via teleport spell to the city where our story begins."}]}

He is a half-orc barbarian."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tiaka Odilopir lived to hunt, roam the wilderness, and battle the hated Orcs of Belkzen with her fellow warriors of her Ustalavian tribe. In all, she led a carefree life until a battle against the cunning Empty Hand Orcs went very wrong. Briefly at her foes' mercy, she suffered the worst humiliation that a warrior can. The Empty Hand were driven off and Tiaka rescued, but the demon spirits of her tribe had already punished her for her weakness. Tiaka bore her punishment with stoicism, but still wanted to make the child within her somehow worthy of her bloodline despite its Orcish taint. She prayed ceaselessly to her clan's demon totem, begging that its power would enter her and overshadow her baby's Orcish corruption. Tiakbos was born under the least auspicious heavenly signs possible and with a full set of fangs more fiendish than Orcish, but his mother drew encouragement from these signs that her prayers had been answered. Now that he is grown, Tiakbos feels the demon spirit's hold on him growing, and lives in terror of the few horrible seconds each day when the fiend takes control and alters his very flesh. But those seconds are growing longer, and he fears that if he does not gain mastery over the totem under which he was born, that it will one day fully rule him. After searching far and wide for a cure to no avail, Tiakbos followed rumors that certain alchemical infusions could suppress a person's darkest urges. If he could not escape the demon, then at least he would steer its energies to be used on his own terms. It mostly works, except when the demon overcomes the drugs and adds the mutagen's strength to its own. Tiakbos is a man without a place in life. He cannot go back to his mother's tribe for fear of how they will use his totemic strength, and the ways of the bloodthirsty Orcs would prove just as tempting to the beast within him. So he keeps his head down, moving from place to place in search of new alchemical texts to study, hoping that his muscles, sharp teeth, and array of Orc weapons salvaged from battlefields will be enough warning to make people leave him alone. It's for their own good. Tiakbos is as tall and as powerful as any Half-Orc, but he tends to hunch over to avoid notice. While not unattractive, he is very quiet and a wallflower. This is not due to shyness, but out of desire to avoid stressful situations that will make his inner demonic beast come forth. Unfortunately, Tiakbos also cannot abide the sight of wrongdoing and those who won't stop bullying others following a stern warning often find themselves facing the slashing teeth that slide forth from his mouth and the horns that erupt without warning from his head."}]}

His mother was a human, however unlike most human women in the tribe, she was not a slave, she was actually the of wife the Warboss Gorguts, Gurak's father. Gurak's tribe was a collection of Orcs, Goblins, Hobgoblins and Ogres. They were a tribe of pseudo-pirates, they would constantly raid other villages via sea, and plunder trade routes and merchant ships for food, gold and weapons. However, Gorguts was tired of the tribes warring with one another and raiding. He wanted a more prosperous future for the Orc tribes, so he began attempting to unite all Orc tribes to stop them from constantly warring with one another and focus on becoming a functioning society rather than a collection of savage tribes attacking and pillaging the innocents of the world, and each other. Gurak really liked the idea of the Orc tribes becoming a functioning society that could possibly have relations with other civilised locations. However, some of the Orcs in the tribe were unhappy with this decision and would rather continue being marauders. Most of these Orcs were strong worshippers of Gruumsh. Gurak's older brother, Bruz, was one of the few Orcs who wanted to continue to rampage across the land. Bruz is full Orc, not Half-Orc like Gurak. One day, Gurak, Bruz, and Gorguts went out to hunt a large Owlbear that had killed a group of scouts from the tribe. After they successfully hunted and killed the Owlbear, Bruz turned around and murdered their father in cold blood before attempting to kill Gurak. Leaving Gurak badly wounded, Bruz returned to their stronghold and told the tribe that both Gorguts and Gurak were killed by the Owlbear. Gurak managed to survive his injuries and returned to the stronghold only to find his brother had become the new Warboss. He wanted to return to the ways of old, marauding other towns and villages, murdering every other tribe that there was, instead of trying to unite them like their father wanted. Most of the tribe were content with this decision and Bruz started sending out war parties to raid other tribes. Gurak was not happy that his brother betrayed him and his father so he abandoned the tribe and began wandering, seeking a more dutiful purpose.  After wandering for months on end, alone, he came across a young Gnome Druid out in the forest named Bimble. The two travelled together for some time looking after each other, Gurak kept the two safe from dangerous wildlife or the occasional bandit while Bimble kept them both healthy and fed. She also taught Gurak how to properly control his anger, and only unleash it when necessary. Gurak is very focused on completing any task he's given, except if Bimble is in danger, in which case he will abandon the mission to keep her safe. Now he just travels wherever she goes because he has no other purpose."}]}

While attacking a small village there, he took Nole Güdfre as a captive. Usually, the captives of G’thnur would be treated as his personal playthings for a time and executed when he felt no more fun from them. Nole Güdfre, however, was able to tap into some form of kindness from the Thagan chief, appealing to his old age and lack of an heir, once she was pregnant. G’thnur released Nole back to her village, where she gave birth to his child. G’thnur insisted that the child not be named until he was old enough to speak and returned to his clan. Nole became a briefly best selling author when she wrote an adventurous memoir of her time with the Thagan clan,  Life With Ug ly Savages. G’thnur would return periodically to help raise his Half-Orc son, unable to read her memoir because he refused to learn the “Tiny-Man-Speak” of Common. The child would be traded from Nole’s village in Praegotbet back to G’thnur’s encampment. With Nole, she used the wealth from her memoirs to have the child properly educated, where he would develop an obsession with the Arcane, wanting to become among the elite Mages of Praegobet. With the Thagan Clan, the boy learned how to survive amongst tougher opponents and participate in the melees of Orc culture. Once the boy was forming proper sentences in both Orc and Common, G’thnur announced to the clan that his name would harken back to the ancestral Orcs, naming the boy Thawginautaut’Frawbuyitfuh’Musulu’alG’thnur. During that same naming ceremony, a drunken G’thnur recounted the story of Thawginautaut’Frawbuyitfuh’Musulu’alG’thnur’s birth, describing how the aftermath was a “disgustingly soupy mess all over the hut.” The nickname stuck across the Thagan encampment. The Güdfre boy returned home to his mother and informed her that his name was “Soupy.” “Soupy” was eventually accepted to the Academy of the Arcane, Praegobet’s leading arcane college. He took up a major in Arcane Research to study the effects of the Arcane, as he himself had no magical ability. (Despite Nole’s decent wealth, the Academy was an expensive school, which led to the 400,000gp loans that haunt “Soupy” even now.) During an anthropology class in his senior year, “Soupy” and his class were participating in a dig to explore Praegobet’s history before the Flower War. While digging through the side of a hill, an errant strike of a pickaxe from one of the students sent a wave of magical energy pulsing through the cave, followed closely by an explosion and subsequent cave-in. When “Soupy” awoke, a tattoo of Tribal Arcane Runes snakes up his arm and to his shoulder, and he found that he could cast magic spells through these runes. His high school graduation ring had been transformed by the magical energy, warped and enchanted to become his Ring of Lost Memories. Academy officials (Praegobet G-Men) informed “Soupy” that he was being removed from the Academy, as to distance Praegobet from a compromising situation involving the explosion, death of students, and confirmation of magic thought extinct. “Soupy” was able to plead his case as a student of the Arcane. The Academy allowed him the opportunity to work on his Thesis (T  he Ecological Effects of Prolonged Arcana Exposure to Various Ecosystems), with the caveat that only if the Thesis was considered passing would he be able to continue earning his place among the Inner Mage Circle. With just enough of a grant to catch a boat to Kara-Tur, “Soupy” set off to begin field research for his Thesis."}]}

He is a half-orc barbarian."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The wizened orc leaned closer to the fire, reflections dancing along the copper caps on his tusks. Young humans, orcs, and half-orcs of the Ghirak clan noticed, and turned their attention to the tribal elder, knowing that a story was coming. The elder took a long sip of some dark liquid, smelling of the sour berries of the hinterlands, and then began.  “This is for you young ones, who look out into the world and want to know your place in it, for this is a story of one much like yourselves, who is still writing his story as we tell it here. Young Kazimir was born in this very village twenty-one years ago, a strong half-orc born to Dragomir and Lyudmila. The stars and signs aligned when he came into the world, and the shamans noticed. They read the knots in the kryta root and listened to the wind voices, and knew that he was chosen by the spirits of the world. Soon enough he was inducted into the shamanic order, bound to keep them safe against the many dangers that our tribe faces.  “By his 16th year Kazimir had proven himself as a warrior of repute. He had bested Orc challengers from the south, and helped Grand Shaman Zvonimir conduct the Midwinter’s Rite. This was of course, some years after the cursed Irrilians came up from the south and were pushing us further and further into the mountains.  At the mention of the Irrilians, older listeners grumbled and barked. The young ones, who had only known Korna after the initial invasion, frowned but did not have the same level of revulsion as those who remembered the heady pre-invasion days.  “At the Grand Shaman’s command, Kazimir went on raiding parties against Irrilian army camps with the war parties. As a member of the shamans, he was somewhat of an outsider to the proud hunters, but they knew his uses--when in combat, Kazimir could lead the rage of the trampled land forth, and crush the Irrilians like snow under our boots. It is said also that the Grand Shaman sometimes sent Kazimir with special instructions. Sometimes it was to gather gem dust for a seeing-ritual. Or to take the scalps of three Southerners for blood rites. Or to find details on the Irrilian’s magics.  “In the early spring of 539 IE, Kazimir was sent out once more to infiltrate and destroy an encampment set up by the Irrilian empire. This was after the imperial palace burned in fire, and their forces were scattered in defeat. This one encampment still stood, however, and it was an insult to our people for it to sully our lands so. The Grand Shaman told Kazimir to go into the central tent and to retrieve an object for study.  “We don’t know what Kazimir was sent to find. We do know that he brought it back in great secrecy and carried it to the Grand Shaman, who summoned other shamans and guardians for a secret conference. Three days later, when the full moon aligned with Kyzor’s Sickle in the sky, they all went up to the peak of Koshtan-Kazbek, for some secret spell. We do not know what it was intended to do, but we know the results. All in the village woke, for it was as if night became day. There was a terrific blast at the top of the mountain, and a rain of ash fell across the slopes.  “Only Kazimir came back from that dread ritual. He would not say what occurred, bound by the oaths of his order. He said that Grand Shaman Zvonimir was now guiding him through the world, to right what was wrong, though scouts confirmed that Zvonimir was nowhere to be found. Left with little choice, our Chief banished Kazimir for sabotage of holy rites.  The expulsion of a member from the tribe is, of course, the most feared fate of the average Ghirakan, and thus many of the young listeners gasped, whereas older ones grimaced.  “Was Kazimir a traitor? Did he bring back a cursed artifact from the Irrilian camp? Why did he survive where elder guardians and shamans died or disappeared? These questions weighed heavily on the elders. Kazimir was ironclad in his assertion that he was following the Grand Shaman’s orders, as always, and that he was on a sacred mission. As such it was with a heavy heart and much doubt that he was banished into the world.  “There is a curious fact that was noticed by Lyudmila, Kazimir’s mother and scout for the clan. A strange tattoo appeared on Kazimir’s face when he returned from the peak, the shape of which had not been seen before. The same mark was seen burned into the cap of Koshtan-Kazbek, as if by great fire. It looked like this: ༄ When asked what this was, Kazimir was cryptic, saying only that it was also known as U+0F04, which made no sense to anyone.  “So Kazimir set out into the wider world, with only his sacred weapon, a strange mark, and the guidance of a disappeared mentor to show him the way. I hope that he is guided well--there are strange times ahead, and Ghirak will need heroes to defend it."}]}

His mother was a victim of a brutal attack from an Orc tribe, in which her husband was killed and she was forced to conceive at the hands of one of the strongest warriors in the raiding party. While she was not the only woman subjected to this brutality that day, she was the only one to carry her child full term and give birth.  As a boy, Pogranax (or \"Pog,\" as he was called) was never entirely accepted around the village, much because he was a constant reminder of the atrocities that many there had suffered through. He was prone to fights with other kids, which he typically won, even when outnumbered.  Instead of choosing to focus on the negative of his conception, his mother Alais focused on the fact that he was her son. Her husband had ever been able to give her a child in their brief years of marriage. Knowing that many of her neighbors would struggle to accept him, she worked to help the boy establish his identity and accept himself, even going so far as to give him a name which she felt reflected his strong Orc heritage.  Pogranax was the quick to volunteer for the village watch, eager to prove himself loyal to his human family. Due to his larger stature, he had learned to fight using blunted broadswords before the other boys his age could even pick one up. Granted, he used both hands, but to him the use of a powerful blow from both shoulders felt natural.  Years had passed since the last major attack on the village, since a wall of raw lumber poles reinforced with stones had been erected to keep the majority of the attacks out. When the large attack had come, the second since Pogranax had been born, it was a fierce battle.  In the middle of the fighting, Pogranax spotted a large orc warrior swinging a hammer at several defending villagers. The head of the weapon was larger than a melon, and tended to explode the heads of the villagers like melons when it made contact. He fought with fury and passion like Pogranax had never seen, and despite loathing him as an enemy, he respected him as a fighter. Despite facing his own enemies, the young half-orc kept an eye on the situation as he made his way into the town square, where the large orc warrior roared and smashed. As armored men kept their distance, bolts from several crossbows pierced the orc's arm and side. Still, he fought on, but as the blood continued to pour, it was obvious that the barbarian was getting weaker. His swings came slower and slower as the wounds fatigued him. Pogranax finally reached the edge of the circle around the orc, and brought his own large weapon up defensively in front of him.  The orc in the middle turned, keeping the village soldiers at bay. As his gaze fell on Pogranax, the half-orc got his first good look at the blood-thirsty brute, and the ground seemed to drop out from beneath his feet. Above the orc's right eye was a large, crescent-shaped scar, his left cheek also scarred by four thin parallel lines. Growing up, his mother had been honest about his lineage.  *******  \"Pogranax, I want you to know where you come from,\" she had told him. \"You cannot hide who you are, but I want you to feel comfortable in your own skin. I do not know who your real father is.\"  \"They attacked at night. We heard the fighting outside. I told Habastad to join the other men, but he stayed to protect me. It wasn't long before he---your real father---burst in the door, letting out a terrible roar. I screamed, and I think it encouraged him. I could see the bodies of dead village guards through the open door behind the orc warrior.\"  \"Habastad, may the Lord in Iron favor him, did his best to defend me, but he was no match. He threw the blow from his axe right at the orc's head, using both hands. While the blade cut through the skin, it bounced off his thick skull, leaving a gaping wound in the shape of the crescent moon. I could see the bone beneath the hanging skin, but the orc just wiped the blood out of his right eye, licking it off his own hand. As Habastad brought his axe up for a second attack, the orc swung his own large weapon. I didn't get a good look at what it was, but it was large and blunt.\"  Her eyes, staring off in the distances of memory, always began tearing up at this point. \"Many things about that night still give me bad dreams and invite the night hag to whisper in my ear, but the sound---that gut-wrenching sound---still haunts me. It was like breaking a bundle of twigs over your knee, but instead, they were bones. Habastad's ribs, actually, as his body was slammed into the wall. He had fallen to the ground, unable to breathe, unable to get up, but he was still alive.\"  At this point, she was typically sobbing. \"I'll never forget Habastad's eyes, wide and watching as the orc warrior forced me to the floor and cut at my clothing with a filthy knife. They were full of despair, despair and regret, as if he'd failed me. He had done his best, he had to have known that, but the orc was just too massive. The orc had forced himself on me then. I screamed again, but he only laughed. I was able to get my right arm free at one point, and struck at his left eye with all of my fury. He flinched, but I still managed to get him with my fingernails, leaving trails of blood down the left side of his face.\" Alais' voice would harden with resolve as she told this part, but would eventually fade off as she concluded. \"That finally did it. I thought he was going to kill me, and at that point, I welcomed it. I saw him lean back, but that was the last thing I remember. He must have punched me, and very hard, because it was close to mid-day by the time I awoke. Habastad was dead. The orcs had left before the morning sun had come up. I was left alone, a widow.\"  *******  As recognition filled Pog's eyes, the large full-blooded orc in front of him narrowed his own, regarding the young half-orc carefully. The men in the circle looked at each other in confusion as the orc began to shake, a low grating sound. The orc was laughing.  Pog watched as the orc lowered his weapon slightly, extending his arms toward Pog, his head tilted to one side as he said one word, the last word Pog wanted to hear at that moment. \"Son.  Pog was not entirely certain what happened next. He was a talented fighter, above average for his age, still not as skilled as a seasoned veteran. But at that moment, he seemed to move like one. With short but efficient strike, Pog's greatsword was suddenly wedged deep into the orc's thick neck, stopping when it hit the spine. It was not a powerful blow, but it had been quick and precise.  The large orc---Pog's father---dropped to its knees, gasping for air with a half-severed wind pipe. All the pain, all the rage, of growing up in a community that barely accepted him for the humanity he possessed had come to the surface in a new way. The additional emotions he had been cursed with from his mother boiled up as well, the vivid image of her crying every time she told of this orc's brutality flashing through Pog's mind. His face betrayed it all like a banner in the wind, and the orc drank it in like mead. He resumed laughing, a deep belly laugh, and grabbed Pog's sword, sliding it out of his throat even as it cut deep into his fingers.  \"What's the matter, human? Do you need a hug?\" The orc gurgled out blood as he spoke. \"Son?\" the orc repeated.  Pog stepped up to the large orc, looking him straight in the eye. \"You may have contributed to my existence years ago, but you are not my father,\" he spat.  A thick arm wrapped around the orc's head, digging his fingers deep into the bloody wound on the neck. Grasping his own wrists, Pog flexed his arms, then threw his entire weight into turning with his hips.  A moment later, something large fell to the ground with a hollow clanking. Pog looked at the gruesome trophy in his hands. The face of his progenitor stared back at him, chuckling again once before the light faded from the eyes.  After the battle was over, the village had finally accepted Pogranax as one of their own. Not only had he fought in their defense against orc kind, he had allegedly destroyed the orc that sired him. It may have been the new found respect, but suddenly the village no longer felt like home.  His mother had been wounded in the attack. She listened to the tales from the other villagers of the encounter in the square---Pog refused to talk about it---and in some sense, she found relief, but also sorrow. While Pog had now confronted his past and where he had come from, he had opened himself up for a new range of personal conflict. A few days later, after Alais had succumbed to her wounds and been buried next to her husband Habastad, Pogranax had bid an emotionless farewell to the village and set off on his own.  He traveled to the largest city in the region and quickly found a merchant caravan willing to hire him as a body guard, which began his journey that took him to the Grand Lodge."}]}

The orcs had common coin enough from their night’s victory and the humans were in no position to refuse a tribe of orcs heady with the rush of sacrament with Gruumsh the one-eyed god.  Half of the tavern was trashed but the gold the orcs left behind was enough to repay the damages- they had little interest in money apart from stealing it from their victims as a sign of power.  Mog of the Desolation was the prized female of the tribe and after she had beheaded no fewer than seven Garguns in their latest battle, Uzrdakh was prepared to take her for his mate queen.  After downing an entire keg of dark ale, Mog was only prepared to take to her bed after such a grueling day.  As it stood, in her intoxicated state she became infatuated with the bartender.  Erik of the Tavern, as she knew him.  Their tribe remained outside of the city for about two weeks before their next campaign to move, but it was enough time for Mog and Erik to experience another form of union better than any the orc had ever known with her god.  When it was discovered Mog was with child, the tribe was excited until it was revealed that Uzrdakh had not yet had congress with her.  It was a great shame that the child was born half-orc and half-human, but the conqueror of the Bloodwastes was publicly willing to accept the child on the grounds that as soon as Mog was able to bear another child, she would give him an heir.  Atirah was the half-breed’s name.  The child was raised among the orcs but was made acutely aware of just how much she differed from her pure-blooded fellows.  Her mother Mog was protective of Atirah, reminded of the kindness and humor of the human Erik who had captured her heart in so short a time.  Uzrdakh took every opportunity to remind the mother and child of his graciousness, and Mog’s duty to withhold her end of the bargain.  When Atirah was 5 years old, she had a brother Kurdusk, the conqueror’s son.  Both Atirah and her brother were bastards in their own right, but the tribe seemed to have new life knowing that Uzrdakh had been blessed with a son to succeed him and lead the orcs to a new glory.  Mog cared for both of her children but privately favored her daughter.  The two children grew up in rivalry and while Atirah had the advantage of age, Kurdusk knew that what she could never accomplish was true sacrament with Gruumsh.  He quickly surpassed his half-sister in combat fueled by the carnal bloodlust and frenzy that came from the mark of their maker.  When Atirah was 12 years of age, her brother 7, Uzrdakh went back on his word and publicly denounced the child of two worlds, declaring her a danger to the integrity of the tribe.  Should Mog oppose him, he would execute the both of them in sacrifice to Gruumsh- otherwise, they would both be spared and the child would only be banished.  Atirah left home that night with nothing but a spear and a deep sense of loss- a conflicted loss as she never truly felt at home in the tribe.  On her first night alone in the woods, she came across a cave of sleeping bears and after slaughtering the three creatures with enthusiasm, she dragged one bloody carcass back to the edge of the camp, where she was greeted by Kurdusk.  “Brother,” she announced with hesitant pride.  “I killed three bears and I understand now.  I felt Gruumsh’s bloodlust within me.  Please tell your father, I can be a trueborn orc.”  But Kurdusk gleefully told Atirah that she could never be trueborn, and if he went to his father tonight it would be to request the privilege of killing his half-sister himself.  “Half-breed, your tribe is worms and your inheritance is death.  You are Atirah for the gallows.”  He produced a whip and proceeded to chase her out into the woods, further than the cave of sleeping, now dead bears, and left her with whip-wounds so severe her back muscles spasmed with pain for a good month.  If you ask now, she will tell you her scars are from numerous tiger fights, or bear-wrestling, and she cannot remember just what claws made what mark.  She would be lying.  Atirah matured to adulthood out in the wilderness.  On her 15th birthday she caught and killed a deer, three rabbits, a beaver, and a crow and ate them all in silence.  Even away from the tribe that raised but never loved her, she tended towards chaos and could occasionally hear whispers of Gruumsh, but even he could not have made Uzrdakh or Kurdusk or even Mog realize the earnestness of Atirah’s desire to belong.  The one-eyed god would not share his sacrament with her, because perhaps it was wasted by the wayward human morality she began to feel in her later years.  She learned to hunt to sustain herself, and while her size betrayed her stealth, she learned to pick prey at a range with arrows and other stolen weapons from stray adventuring parties.  Eventually, aged 16, she found a city which was a thing she had never seen before.  Mog had described them as tribes of hundreds and thousands who kept their houses rooted in the ground.  Atirah was unsure if every city had one, but her mother had spoken fondly of a wooden stronghold with a bird eating a flower above the door.  It was here Atirah met her father, and it was here she learned what it meant to be human, even if only half.  Erik was surprised, to say the least, to know that he had an adult orc daughter as a result of that brief encounter all those years ago.  The Raven and Rose tavern had since been rebuilt of much stronger material, and policy limited traveling parties to groups of ten or fewer.  Erik inherited the building when the previous owner died of pox some six years ago.  While his fellow tavern workers opposed the idea of keeping an orc around in any fraction, be it half or whole or even a toe’s worth, Erik was curious to know if his daughter shared any of the same affectations and affections as Mog, what little he remembered of that two week tryst.  Atirah took a job hauling barrels with which even the human men had difficulty they were too prideful to admit.  She also hunted game occasionally, beasts being her favored foe, and brought the meat to the tavern.  The only payment she wanted was roof over her head and stew enough to live off of.  Whenever anyone asked who she was, she would say, “Atirah of the Gallows”.  She was not for death, as her brother had told her, but she came from it.  It was her history and one day her future, but for the time being she was alive and she planned to live.  Atirah did not come from the Desolation or the Bloodwastes, but from the noose-neck of death itself and she walked away from it.  Of course, as time wore on Atirah of the Gallows became Atirah o’th’ Gallows, then Atirah Gall’os, and eventually just Gallus.  Her orc name faded from greeting except for the few who knew her well.   At age 21, she was known to all as Gallus, the goodnatured if not overly zealous bouncer at The Raven and Rose tavern who would knock your block off if you dared to start a drunken brawl.  Some believed she was almost too eager to see a fight starting up, so she could jump in and bash heads just a bit before throwing you out.  On rare occasions, she was known to bite off your ear to really slow things down.  Underneath the bar, in pickling liquid, there was a jar of bitten-off ears that Gallus never showed to anyone except those who might join the collection.  She was also a rare shot at darts.  The following year, she lost her father and her tavern and her home.  After an afternoon’s hunt, she returned to find the wooden stronghold in flames.  As citizens gathered to watch the liquor-tongued flames leap into the sky, Gallus saw a coin bearing the mark of Gruumsh and his horrible eye left on the cobblestones outside the scorched tavern.  That night, she slept horribly. She awoke weeping.  It was tough to find work in that city after the fire, because without Erik the people had no reason to love an orc-born bastard.  Gallus moved to the next city over, taking what little pay she had actually accepted from The Raven and Rose, using it to find temporary accommodations while she practically begged for a job.  She took up work at The Cock and Bull, another tavern, doing the only work she was really good at.  The owner, a Halfling, was pleased to have Gallus’s height and bravado in the tavern.  She hired the orc, who did three times the labor of any human man just to endear herself to the owner.   Gallus managed to fall into the routine once more, hauling kegs, hunting game, and drinking ale while she ate dinner from the meat she’d brought in.  It was steady work, and while she wondered what had become of Mog, she didn’t dare to make any indication of her presence to the old tribe.  For the first time in her life she hoped that Gruumsh would forget his wayward half-orc child, trying to stave off his evil as she worked for a better future.  She didn’t walk away from the gallows to turn back into the arms of death, after all."}]}

Trystan is an elf druid."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Ravenscar clan is a long line of specialized hunters. Legend says one of there forefathers even caught death itself. Now, the family is not that heroic anymore, but very wealthy. Trystan was born as the third son of Mortimer and Eleanor Ravenscar. Mortimer had been a great hunter once, though no one could see that through all his pudginess. He was a very kind man, in contrast with his wife Eleanor, who was cold and ambitious. She insisted that her sons were taught how to hunt in the old fashioned way.  Trystan’s childhood was filled with hunting trips together with his brothers, mother and occasionally specialized tutors. At first Trystan loved them. He got to go to some amazing places and see new animals and plants. He asked a lot of questions and soaked in as much information as he could. However, at one point they started pushing him to kill the animals. Trystan couldn’t get it over his heart. In the beginning his mother thought it was just an age thing, but as Trystan got older he still didn’t want to. She tried several methods: using a knife, shooting it from a distance, laying traps. Nothing worked. At one point she was so desperate that she put herself in danger. That did get Trystan to kill it, but it upset him so much that he fled home.  For a few years he lived in the wild on his own. He learned how to kill out of necessity. He loved the time on his own and being one with the nature around him.  After three years a magical message reached him telling him of his fathers passing. Trystan was devastated and immediately traveled back. The whole house was in sorrow. However, there was not much time for sorrow. Tradition demanded that the three sons had to battle to become the new head of the Ravenscar clan. Not a battle by force, but more like a quest. They would each receive one of the family scimitars and then set out. The first one to bring back a Arthorax would get the position. Trystan had mixed feelings about it. He did not want to kill a living being, but he also wanted to please his mother for old time’s sake.  As the youngest, Trystan had to wait for his brothers to go first. When he finally started on his journey he used his knowledge to gather a lot of information about the species. Then he traveled to the region where they lived and studied their behavior for quite some time. After he thought he had a thorough understanding of the being he laid a trap. Against all odds he actually managed to capture one before his brothers did, a young one. However, he still had a long way home, made much longer by the fact that the Arthorax was still alive.. On this way he met his brother, Morrigan. He congratulated Trystan on his feat and said he was the rightful heir. The next morning he was gone and so was the Arthorax. Trystan had been betrayed by his own brother. This was the tipping point for Trystan. He absolutely despised the ways of his family. He did not want to be part of a family that chose prey over their own blood.  He followed his brother back to the family manor. Morrigan was welcomed with great festivities. The ceremonial execution of the monster was scheduled the next day. When everyone in the house was asleep, full of the fine wine and food of the dinner, Trystan snuck into the dungeon’s. He freed the Arthorax and ran away from his home with the intention never to return. He brought the animal back to where it came.   Since he has been living in the wild on his own, disowned by his family. He went on many adventures involving nature preservation and studies of lifeforms. "}]}

He was very young when a Dragon became agitated and started burning down his village, but was saved, mostly as an after thought, by the Wizard who had come to slay the Dragon (and, in fact, originally stirred it from slumber and made it agitated). The Wizard, Triskell, adopted Bessir as his servant, and took him back to his tower. Triskell was a brilliant Wizard, always pushing forward to bounds of understood magic, but he was sloppy and idle-minded a lot of the time, so many of his experiments would get loose, or cause havoc in his tower. Bessir learned how to use magic from the scraps of knowledge his master threw away, that Bessir was forced to clean up, and learned how to use this magic of Abjuration to calm and banish the horrors that his master unleashed and then abandoned.  Bessir bound together his one and only true possession - a diary/grimmoire - out of the scraps his master left behind. When Bessir asked his master - who he saw as a distant but uncaring father, who definitely didn't reciprocate those feelings - who his parents were, and in turn, what his last name was, Triskell gave him a half answer. Triskell told him that he was no one, a nothing, a no body. He told him that all he was good for was keeping the stairs of Triskell's tower. Bessir wrote in his diary, that evening, his own last name: Keepstair.  When Triskell was approached by a group of adventurers to aid them in their quest to rid the world of a terrible evil, Triskell was busy elsewhere, and instead sent his servant who he admitted would pass for the lowest of Wizards - but a Wizard none-the-less."}]}

During one of her escapades, Gwynnifer came across a discarded ocarina in a hollowed out tree. While the instrument was but an amusing pastime for her, it was a treasured item for the trickster archfey, Efnysien, the Lord of Luck and Song, who had misplaced the ocarina.  Once while she played the ocarina, Efnysien heard the sound of his misplaced instrument through a fey crossing nearby. He approached her, disguised as an elf and begged her to cease her audial assault, even going so far as to offer her lessons for her compliance. Gwynn should have perhaps been more suspicious of meeting a strange elf in the forest, but instead she was captivated by the strange and unknown.  They would meet several times a week for Gwynnifer’s lessons. Although her musical skill was quite appalling, Efnysien saw potential. As a bard himself, there was much he could teach her, and the young halfling was willing to learn if only to hear his tales of mischief and intrigue to fuel her wild imagination.   It wasn’t long before the archfey picked up on Gwynnifer’s wanderlust and offered to spirit her away from the quaintness of the village and she simply could not refuse.

His wife Callie is responsible for most of the magic, and their children Cade, Finnan, Jillian, and Cora play rotating roles throughout the night. Cade is a master of disguise, able to slip into any role with ease. Fin and Jill, the twins, are singers, and often perform duets together. Cora takes more of a behind-the-scenes role, assisting with the various illusions the show requires, as well as “other” things.  It is a well-known fact that where there are bards, pickpockets follow. The shows bards provide are excellent distractions, and pickpockets love distracted people. It just so happens that the Talespinners have their own resident thief in Cora. Her parents noticed her deft, quick fingers and propensity to shy away from the limelight early, and encouraged her talents as much as they had encouraged those of her older siblings. Alton enlisted the help of his son Cade to teach her the best ways to hide; to slip in and out unnoticed, or if noticed, at least in the guise of another person. Callie taught her the basics of illusion and enchantment, small tricks to distract and confuse her targets that helped just as much with theft as escape. The twins, who had “worked the crowd” until Cora was old enough, taught her how to pick out likely targets; fat purses aren’t always the easiest to find, and they’re not always carried by easy marks.  Growing up a Talespinner meant hearing stories of heroes and villians, great beasts and great battles, magic and adventure. While her family was content to tell these stories, reveling in the rapt attention and adoration of their audiences, Cora wanted more. She wanted her own stories, her own adventures. Her family traveled, sure, but she often only saw the roads and towns, the relatively safe places in the world. She wanted to see the mountains, caves, oceans, and dark forests, to fight some of the great beasts from the stories.

My father, Gorim Gamwort, was a member of the city militia, and was killed when attempting to arrest a murderer. She escaped, having taken three other militia constables out during the arrest attempt. I had a happy childhood, aside from losing my father a young age, with many extended family members around helping to raise me. My father's mother, who I called Gamgee, would feed me butterscotch candies when I helped her in her garden.  My aunt on my father's side, Grayra Gamwort, helped my mother bring me up, and kept my father's memory alive with me through stories. The only family that I have regular contact with is my mum, and my Aunt Grayra. I try to send letters and care packages to them regularly, and will pack up and return to Amnwater, sometimes with little warning. Grayra lives with mum, caring for her in her illness. I've been married twice. The first time, in my youth, was to Bregwen Odiwyn, also from Amnwater. That marriage lasted about 2 years... she didn't like that I was on the road constantly, so she left me. We remain friendly, and she checks in on mum regularly. She's a blessed soul that deserved better. I have a tattoo with her initials on my left shoulder. My second marriage happened ten years later. Idazana Trynlyse was her name. She was a fellow smuggler, and we got along famously. We worked many routes and scams together...  until she decided that the stakes on one job were much better suited to her alone. She stole away in the middle of the night, taking the money and my heart, leaving nothing but a note, sealed with a kiss, saying that she loved me but the gold was too good. I haven't seen her since. The pain of her betrayal has faded over the past twenty years, with only a small resentment remaining. I'm originally from Amnwater. I lived there for my entire childhood, but once I started as a courier / smuggler in my early adulthood, I moved around a lot. I initially returned quickly to Amnwater between jobs, but as the contracts got bigger (and less legitimate), I'd take longer and longer to return. I was an only child, and as older family members passed, the task of providing for the family fell to me. To do this, I began to work as a courier. Initially, I was a legitimate businessman, taking packages and parcels to various places for various people. Soon, though, I found that taking jobs from less mainstream sources lead to more money, which meant I was able to keep my mum more comfortable. She didn't ask questions, but Grayra is suspicious, and questions me regularly, reminding me that my father was a member of the constabulary, without saying outright that I'm dishonouring his memory. Right now, I am just trying to keep my mum comfortable.  I'll send my cut of the profits back to Amnwater via a trusted courier from my own network. She's very sick though, and no doctor or sage knows why. She's old, but if she were healthy, she'd have quite a few years left in her. Otherwise, I'm certain it won't be more than a couple of years until she dies. After that? Perhaps finding the third wife, perhaps gathering enough wealth to start a legitimate courier business. Of late, I found myself in Neverwinter, after hearing of an opportunity for a big score. I figure that if he can make one more big job, I will be able to head home and give mum the rest she truly deserves before she dies. I wear, currently, a heavy leather overcoat that functions as leather armour, sporting a bright purple shirt beneath. I brandish my rapier on his belt, and when traveling, strap my short-bow to his back. I keep a neatly trimmed and sculpted beard, and my wavy, brown hair falls nearly to my shoulders.

Unluckily, she wasn't what the goblins were fishing for, she they threw her back into the river.   She floated along for hours more before, fortunately, she was fished out again by a group of exceptionally mean kobolds fishing on that river. Unfortunately, those kobolds were dicks, and they took her drift wood and threw her back in the river.

Gwynn drifted along for hours more, even days, before she was fished out again for a third and final time by a group of exceptionally competitive goliaths. She was able to convince these goliaths that she did, in fact, count as a catch, and that as she was the largest thing pulled from the river that day, her savior was to be named the best fisher-goliath, but only if they didn't throw her back.   The river was full of fish, so the goliaths decided not to eat young Gwynn. In fact, the kind-hearted nomads allowed her to travel with them, in hopes that she may one day find her way home.   Determined not to be a burden, Gwynn learned to pull her own comparatively small weight. She learned to track from her very tall friends, and thanks to her close proximity to the ground, she proved to have a knack for it. She learned to fire a bow, and thanks to her natural halfling dexterity, she excelled at it. Gwynn learned to survive, thrive even in the wild forests their group traveled through, and she loved every minute of it.   As a group of hunters and trackers, the goliaths would often take on bounties for fugitives and monsters troubling the settlements they traveled to, and it was in that endeavor that Gwynn found her true calling. She threw herself into tracking the group's targets and delighted in the battles to subdue their prey. She especially relished in any contract for goblins and kobolds, as she nursed quite a grudge for those that threw her back in the river.   Gwynn and her gang of gargantuan goliaths soon became good friends. She listened very carefully to all of their stories and learned a great deal about the world from her nomadic buddies. They even came to see her like a mascot of the group, and she grew to be more like them every day. By the time the nomads found their way to Gwynn's humble halfling village, nothing remained of the quiet young halfling girl that fell into the river many months before. In almost every way except physically, she had become one of the goliaths. Even her own parents didn't recognize her as they entered the settlement.   Within hours, she grew bored of the quiet halfling life she had lived before, and within days, she had pissed off most of the village with her now decidedly goliath antics and sensibilities. Only a week after her return, she said goodbye to her humble halfling parents and set out on the path again with her new nomadic goliath family to find adventure. "}]}

No one came to claim her as she was being nursed to health over many months. When she was back on her feet, it seemed to her the kindness of the strangers who saved her ran out and an ultimatum was made: she had a home as long as she was willing to be a servant. Faced with what would potentially be indefinite servitude by her 'saviors', she chose to escape during the dead of night.  Young and alone in the unfamiliar city of Daftoros, she did her best to survive using her wits, guile, and inherent charm. For a while, she was taken under the wing of a dwarven man named Belven, an older member of the local thieves' guild. He took pity on the girl and helped foster some of her earliest talents at survival. Though he never took her as a charge, he was as close to a companion she had, and he often came in and out of her life at random times. When she was on her own, many gave her food simply because they found the odd little halfling girl to be adorable, not knowing that moments ago she had likely picked the pockets of some rich member of society that passed through. Still, despite honing less than reputable talents in thieving to stay afloat - and it truly was the only way to keep her from dying on the streets from hunger - she did her best to never steal from someone who looked like they needed the coin. It somehow made what she was doing a little more justifiable in her mind, especially as she got older. That those rich folk were easy targets didn't hurt, and she always managed to slip in and out without getting caught.   At least, she thought she had been under the radar. In truth, the hardy little halfling had grabbed the attention of the Keep from the very beginning. The fact a child survived the relic's devastation had been a miracle to begin with, and her being saved had all been part of a plan to watch her development to see if she could be of use someday. When she chose to leave who she'd been initially placed with, the decision was made to give her a bit of a wide berth to see where things went.  Years passed. The young halfling grew up to become a woman that tried not to be hardened by years of poverty and homelessness. Despite keeping to herself and trying not to get into any more trouble beyond the type that kept food in her belly, she gained a reputation with the criminal element of town as being rather skillful at keeping out of sight and taking things. Because of her own moral code, she never really considered the offers of various thieving groups over the years to join them. She never thought she'd consider an offer, truly.  Until she did.  When her talent finally garnered her the attention of a well-known thieves' guild, she had initially resisted...until they promised her a payoff that could get her off the streets for good. It was an offer too tempting to be true, but in her desperation for a better life, a life without scrounging to survive, a life she always /wanted/, she agreed to it.  In the end, she succeeded. Despite the job being been far more complicated than she ever imagined, she got her hands on the object she had been told to take. It would've been a clean getaway, if not for the fact that the entire thing had been a set-up. Though she had been initially terrified and even tried to escape, she eventually was fully captured.  She assumed she was going to be carted off to jail. Instead, a woman named Ane Mone explained to her that she had been personally monitored and chosen for her abilities to do something for the greater good of the kingdom. That she had just past a test she hadn't even known she had been taken and had proven that she was ready to join the Keep.  In the end, the offer included exactly what she had wanted to begin with - a place to stay. Coin. Food. That she was going to be tasked with helping keep the same kind of relics that laid waste to her childhood village just felt like a bonus if you asked her. They did not have to say much more for her to agree with the terms laid in front of her."}]}

He goes by Corrin (the local Halfling name most similar to his nickname, Kari, but more easily pronounceable to people in the region).  Maningrida is a rural halfing town in a steppe area near the coast.  Its primary industry is fishing and herding.  Llira, the goddess of Joy, is the primary diety worshipped there.  Kari was trained as a painter and storyteller growing up, two roles which often go hand in hand in his town.  He learned the traditional Plains halfling painting style from his mentor, a woman named Tulloun.  It involves painting scenes from the history and religion of the area onto the walls of mud brick homes, with heavy use of of bright pigments and especially shades of red and purple.  He also made his own, nontraditional art which drew on traditional styles but was super weird and conceptual.  A lot of his pieces involved painting features from different landscape scenes on top of each other without regards to perspective.  Naturally nobody would let him do this on their homes, so he had to use canvas.  He also learned many stories from Maningrida’s history by heart, along with two other young halflings, Wonambi and Yero, as part of their training as keepers of the oral tradition.  There are always three keepers who pass on their histories independently for the purpose of keeping them as accurate as possible.  Tulloun was the one in charge of Kari, the other two older generation historykeepers were assigned to the others.    Despite the fact that they were not allowed to study together or talk to each other about the stories they were learning, Kari become close friends with Wonambi (nicknamed Ambi) and Yero.  Possibly because of their shared role, they felt a bond that was stronger than that of their other friends, who grew up learning a craft or to herd or fish.  Several years after becoming friends, they ended up in a rather unexpected poly relationship when Kari and Yero, by complete coincidence, both asked Ambi out on a date just two days apart from each other.  She didn’t want to turn either of them down and so the idea of all dating each other was proposed.  Aside from Ambi and Yero, Kari’s closest friend was a half-human girl named Josina (her mother was a human traveler who had settled in the region and ran a general store).  He would often follow Josina when she tended her family’s herds, in order to find cool landscapes to paint.  Josina was also a nontraditional artist in her free time, so they got along well.  Kari is agender and comfortable with any pronouns; most people initially gender him as male because he was assigned male at birth and presents vaguely masculine most of the time, but some of his closer friends use other pronouns.  The plains Halfling dialect doesn’t use gendered pronouns but there is a general term for transfeminine people, which he was grouped under.  He was never particularly bothered by this classification—it was understood that there was considerable diversity of gender identities covered by it—but he was also more masculine than most such classified people.  Traditionally, though this wasn’t a hard and fast social rule, transfeminine people were also considered to be particularly good history-keepers.  Tulloun and Ambi are both transgender women, while Yero is a cis girl and Ambi and Yero’s mentors are cis men.    At age 20, Tulloun was teaching Kari one day when she was suddenly possessed by Llira.  Llira warned Kari that, in 5 years time, an unknown danger would threaten Maningrida from the west.  She told him that, as the town was a place of joy that she very much wanted to protect, she had decided to choose Kari to be a holy warrior and a representative for the town, to go west and train while learning about the coming danger in order to return to protect the town 5 years later.  He was not happy about this development at all.  Kari loved his town, and his family, friends and girlfriends and really didn’t want to leave.  Not only that, he thought he was the worst possible person to choose for the task.  He had no experience with either fighting or magic and was super anxious about any sort of battle.  There were plenty of young halflings much stronger and braver than him.  But you can’t exactly argue with your town’s patron goddess.  So reluctantly, he took up his sword and a holy symbol of Llira, and set off.  He also rolled up some of his canvas paintings that he hadn’t given away to friends and relatives, to bring as keepsakes of his home.  Leaving Maningrida wasn’t an entirely negative experience, though.  He was excited to see the world outside the coastal plains where he grew up.  Travelling merchants from faraway lands had sparked his curiosity with their stories of life in the cities, in places with different climates and different people.  His excitement dampened considerably after a few weeks travelling west.  He didn’t really know if he was even in the right place, and Llira never came back to give him any clarification.  He decided the best course of action was to settle down somewhere, train in his paladin powers and hope the other part of his quest became apparent in its own time.  Now going by Corrin, he joined an adventurer’s guild known as the League of Hardcore Finest, met some interesting people, and got up to some adventurous shenaningans while learning to use the powers Llira had given him.  He started going out with a kind but misunderstood half-orc named Guz after convincing him to stop working with an evil wizard.  He also asked out a Halfling named Schmidt after rescuing them from an airship slowly being consumed by mysterious forces form the far realm (he’s still waiting on their answer though).  He is a bit happier now than when he first arrived in town, but is still feeling rather lost and directionless. "}]}

You’ve probably heard of me. Or at least read one my articles. Probably. Unless you’re one of those philistines getting their news from such contemptibly biased publications as This Week’s Good Work or Tower School Times. At least the Gazette sells itself as unsubstantiated rumor. Anyway, the boss suggested that I pull together a bio for that big column coming my way.  Berna Fen: A bit harsh kid. The hard-bitten reporter angle might not do it for you. Keep trying.  The Enduring Tale of Micah Starbloom (working title) Born to Lyrus and Penelope Starbloom, Micah’s early life was that of farmer’s son. Never as strong or dedicated as his siblings, Micah often struggled to help around the farm. Finding it easier to persuade neighboring children of the joys of hard work, Micah spent his earliest years learning the value of words well spoken. Unfortunately, his mother decided to cultivate this skill with schooling in letters, numbers, and logic, claiming Micah might be bound for a future beyond Farlow village. Naturally, this meant nothing to the boy who was often stuck inside learning, while his brother and sister finished their chores and had the rest of the day to themselves. But after a few years, Micah found himself tending ledgers for many of his neighbors, and even recording official crop yields for Kern’s Harvesters.  Of course, Micah’s parents left him some time to enjoy himself. On one childhood expedition, Micah and his brother, Joren, decided to explore a local cave. Down they went, damp and squeezing darkness outside the light of their one lantern. Too many twists and turns ended in a wide cavern. After some searching, Joren found a pile of old bones and was immediately pounced on by a centipede thing the size of a cart. The lantern was smashed, plunging everything into darkness. Micah heard a few moments of struggle, followed by a whimper and silence. Then the clack, clack, clack of far too many legs slowly making their way toward him. Micah tried to run, but was paralyzed with fear. He felt a slimy tentacle work its way across his face, then a paralyzing poison flood into his arms and legs. Micah smelled decay all around him and saw as a corona of tentacles opened around gaping mandibles.  Somehow his mind had conjured the face of this monster. And then Micah was thrown from the grasping tentacles. He watched as a silhouette stabbed and slashed at the centipede against a backdrop of silver light. Bursts of lightning flew from the source of the light. After hours, which couldn’t have been more than a few seconds, the creature fell to the ground. Micah heard a familiar voice call to him as darkness flooded his vision again.  Awakened to a lullaby he was far too old for, Micah found himself in his bed with Penelope at his side. A frantic moment revealed Joren was also in the room, bandaged and bruised but otherwise fine. After trying to tell his story, Penelope described how she and Lyrus had found the boys, having fallen and hurt themselves in the cave. She discounted the tale of some gallant figure battling a monster as Micah’s imagination running a little wild in the dark.  The years that followed were filled with study as Micah scoured the village for some explanation of what he saw. He learned much of the world from the few books he found, and gained a particular fondness for the travelling storytellers who came through Farlow on festival days. Stories were told of great battles between heroes and monsters in the deepest pits of the world and on the highest mountain tops. Someone else may have accepted some mythical hero or a panic induced delusion, but Micah was set on uncovering a greater truth.  These years also brought tragedy; Penelope began to fall ill. Despite the ministrations of medicine and magic, a wasting disease set into her bones. Increasingly, Penelope spent her days bed ridden, singing harsh and haunting melodies in a language Micah had never heard. As a final gift, Penelope taught her son his mother tongue, Orcish. In his mother’s final moments, Micah sang the same lullaby he had heard years ago, after the cave.  Until that moment Micah had never really questioned his family. He knew his mother was an orc and his father was a human, that his brother and sister looked similar to his parents. He knew orcs were supposed to be vicious monsters, but his mother had never been anything but loving. It had been explained that he was a Halfling and understood he was adopted. Strangers had always seemed uncomfortable around his family, but Micah always thought that was strangers being strange. The people of Farlow had always seemed happy to see Lyrus and Penelope.  While his family grieved, Micah scoured the farm for some clue to his parents’ past. And he found it. In a chest hidden in a corner of the attic, Micah found some relics of a past life, including the journal of Lycinius Atrarch, Spell-Shield of the Realm of Kaith. It told the story of a minor noble battling orcs on the Western front, eventually imprisoning a vicious and cunning orc shamaness. During the return from the Roving Lands, Lycinius’ troop was ambushed by a pair of hill giants. As his comrades were slain and one of the giant raised its great club, Lycinius prepared to embrace a warrior’s end. Then lightning tore from the sky, striking the giant dead. Lycinius watched as his prisoner called forth elemental powers in his defense. Together, the pair slew the final giant.  The journal continued, detailing a grudging respect and growing attraction between Lycinius and Paren’ha, spirit-speaker of the Crow Clan. The pair travelled to Hathar, skirting both the Kaith Expeditionary Force and outriders of the orc tribes. There they found more allies, foiled a plot to incite a bloody war between humans and orcs, and stopped the sorcerer behind it from summoning one of the Deep Ones. Having gained the king’s favor, this bunch of adventurers went onto many more adventures, even saving a village named Farlow from a child-stealing Creature of the Corn. The journal entries end abruptly as Lycinius and Paren’ha travel to investigate a fallen star in the Verite Mountains with their friends, the Halfling burglar Marrian Farstride, and the Wood Elf ranger Quentarin Red-String.  In the chest, Micah found a rawhide packet of Orcish songs and rituals, including his mother’s lullaby, “Little One Come Home.” Between the pages was black-bone flute and as Micah touched it, for a moment he could hear the horns and taste the dust of his mother’s homeland.  Night had come by the time Micah took notice of his surroundings. He rushed out find the entire village around Penelope’s funeral pyre. Many kind words were said of her character and her service to Farlow, though none mentioned a shaman who negotiated the release of children from a monster. After all others had left, Lyrus spent one last night by his wife’s side.  Micah tried more than once to ask his father about the journal, but Lyrus was no longer the jovial farmer with the easy smile. He stumbled through his routine lifelessly. With his children grown and Penelope dead, Lyrus lost his purpose and he would not entertain the inquiries of his youngest child into stories better left untold.  So, Micah left with a set of scrivener’s tools, a flute, and a book of Orcish songs. A note on the hearth stated that he was bound for Hathar and that he would find out the truth of his mother, father, and maybe even his birth parents. And the note thanked his father for protecting Micah on a night many years ago. The journey to Hathar and Micah’s early time there involved some small adventures of minor consequence. Robbed, swindled, and generally unprepared for the wider-world, Micah’s travels made for a difficult lesson. His skill with writing did land him a short-lived position with Barley and Oats law firm. Micah was eventually deemed persuasive but lacking the backbone to pursue a legal career. Other jobs were similarly unsuccessful until Micah found a position as a freelance writer for the Hathar Gazette.  Today the Gazette provides a living while Micah works to uncover his family’s past. Despite the paper’s utter lack of reasonable reputation, Micah has found a knack for convincing people to reveal their secrets. And really, who could possibly care that the Dean of Transmutation is having an affair with a research assistant. Or that the King and Queen have been sleeping in separate rooms for the past week. Or that a Justice has been seen dispensing more alms than nooses lately. No one believes this trash anyway.  Berna Fen: As much as I know you admire our work here, do remember that I provide that living as you search for some sacred truth of your past. Otherwise I’ll bet this little sob story will get you dedicated readers one day. Keep the stories coming, that piece on the merciful Justice was particularly juicy.  "}]}

He is a halfling bard."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Neeto Silverspeak is a halfling bard, hailing from the rolling hills of Evermeadow Plot in central Faerun. He was born Nelan Nimblepipe, and raised by his parents on a mid-sized tobacco farm in the countryside. His father was strict, yet loving, and set him to work in the tobacco fields at the age of 8. His mother was a lovely lady, whose every waking hour was spent in the kitchen, preparing food for her \"big strong farm boys\". Neeto had a strong relationship with his mother, but his laziness and aptitude for the eloquent clashed with his father's simple, rustic way of life. Neeto and his father often fought, his father insisting that Neeto stay with the family and eventually inherit the farm, while Neeto shunned the manual labor and preferred to stay indoors studying poetry and orations with the hopes of eventually becoming a noble at a high court.   At the age of 14, after a particularly nasty argument, Neeto decided he had had enough. That night, he snuck into his father's bedroom, and stole the entirety of his family's fortune: a measly 27 gold and 42 copper pieces. Telling himself it was an early inheritance, he left his home and set off for greater heights. After weeks of travel and many close calls, Neeto made it to the city of Canyonrun. The capital of the region of Stavin's Desert, it was here that he took on the persona of Neeto Silverspeak. It wasn't long before Neeto discovered how expensive it could be to be rich, and he spent nearly all his money on a secondhand cloak from an upscale street vendor. Not having enough to afford a room at the inn, he slept under a parked wagon. The next day, he confidently strode to the castle to request an audience with the king. \"If I can just meet him\", he thought, \"Surely any noble would be amazed at the most intellectual 14-year-old halfling in the land.\" His dreams were shattered by the guards at the entrance to the castle, who laughed at his pitiful, bombastic, and meticulously rehearsed request, and sent him away.   Out of money, and now homeless in an unfamiliar land, Neeto had no choice but to turn to thieving to survive. Joining a pack of street urchins, Neeto learned much about the arts of deception, thievery, and, when things turned south, escape. After dozens of strikes, tackles, and pursuits from various shopkeepers and street vendors, Neeto learned quickly how to leverage his small frame to get out of a sticky situation. Often, he ended a chase by climbing the exterior of a building, and leaping from rooftop to rooftop. As a result, he is amazingly nimble when need be, and completely at home at dizzying heights.   After a while, Neeto grew bored of the simplicity of the snatch and grab or simple \"distract the mark\" con. He began developing more elaborate scams and incorporated his urchin friends into them. Eventually, he established himself as sort of a de facto leader, a position he enjoyed greatly. Under his guidance, the urchins began making significantly more from unsuspecting targets, and even established a sort of communal hideout in an old house with a caved in ceiling. The next step was to pay off a few of the worse off guards to either look the other way, or even openly join in racketeering scams. This proved to be immensely profitable, and as his wealth increased, Neeto found himself diving further and further into his alter ego, until Nelan Nimblepipe was just a faint glimmer in his memory.   The corruption of city guards did not go unnoticed by the authorities however. One day, after a particularly successful day and an appropriately large meal from his favorite inn, Neeto returned to his hideout to find the royal guard waiting for him. Despite his surprise, he managed to escape and fled the city, leaving behind his urchin clan and all of his wealth, save the clothes on his back. He traveled to the Southern reaches of Faerun, to the city of Hammerglass, where he adopted the identity of a used wagon salesman. After a good sanding and a coat of paint, his rotting, decrepyt wagons passed for nearly new, and he found that outgoing merchants were more than happy to trade their worn carriages (plus a little gold) for a shiny, \"like new\" model. After a few days at one location, he would pack up his inventory and move elsewhere, simultaneously avoiding unhappy customers and local merchant's taxes.       Neeto kept up this racket for years, moving from abandoned plot to abandoned plot, selling wagons and making just enough to live a lavish life - at least, lavish for a halfling farmer. At night, Neeto often slept in one of his wagons, a trade-in that was in good shape. He spent much of his money on books, poems, and even hearing tales told by skillful storytellers. However, for every copper he spent on money, two were spent on food and drink. A potent combination of halfling disposition and a burning curiosity about the life of societies elite lead Neeto to indulge tremendously in food, drink, and other pleasures. His fortune never fully disappeared, but it also never accumulated. Instead, he lived wagon sale to wagon sale, never more than a week or two from being broke, but also just as close to an ill-earned paycheck. As Neeto's rhetoric and command of speech improved, he began to grow dissatisfied with simply manipulating words and people. Instead, he set his sights on magics, and the powers that they could unlock. He studied the works of Eludrian, Corestus, Ragh-tor, Himmel Stayne, and Grosh, all master bards and inspiring leaders with a great many works. He began dabbling in magic, carrying a materials pouch and even pretending to cast spells and ward off spirits for gullible individuals. However, the magic eluded him.   Nearly ten years after his escape from Canyonrun, Neeto met a teifling who professed to sell magical components that could unlock hidden magical secrets within yourself. The teifling then demonstrated, having Neeto crush a dried acorn, which, when thrown to the ground, appeared to spawn a beautiful flash of light. Unbeknownst to Neeto, the light was created by the teifling himself, and the dried acorn was picked up off of the road moments beforehand. Blinded by his desperation, Neeto bought the sales pitch, but slyly offered to trade his \"finest\" wagon for the materials. The teifling agreed, and Neeto gleefully made off with the \"magical components.\" In no time at all, Neeto discovered that the compnents had mysteriously lost their power, and it was about that time that an angry, sweaty teifling came stomping into his wagon yard, carrying the majority of a splintered wagon wheel, with a large chunk of rotted axle. Wouldn't you know it, said the teifling, but the \"fine\" wagon had just happened to break down a half mile down the road. Neeto countered by raising the question of how it just so happened that the materials only worked when the magical was around. The two parties, each afraid of being exposed, but even more indignant at being conned by the other, began a heated argument. Before it could come to blows, the two were interrupted by a group of armed men. As it so happened, one of Neeto's unhappy customers had finally managed to track him down, and had arrived with some mercenaries to exact his revenge. The teifling surprised Neeto by informing the man, in no uncertain terms, to kindly go pound sand. A fight ensued, and Neeto watched in terror as the sorcerer engulfed his would-be murderers in a spout of flame.   After a minute of silence, Neeto cautiously proposed an alliance, whereby the two teamed up to double their con. Neeto, the friendlier face, would act as the face of the duo, while the exotic teifling could flex his magical muscles as an enforcer and intimidator. To his surprise, the teifling accepted, and the prolific duo of Neeto and Griffin were born. After liquidating his wagon stock, Neeto and Griffin traveled north to Waterdeep, where they ran various scams and racketeering. Neeto found himself intimidated by Griffin's presence and propensity for violence, but was grateful for the companionship and protection. After months of travel, Neeto finally worked up the courage to admit to Griffin that he had always envied the magic that he wielded, and that he would like to know if Griffin could teach him how to use his own magical potential. Griffin laughed at Neeto, touting his magical heritage and assuring the halfling that true magic came from ancestry. However, Neeto insisted, and offered to give up most of his earnings for Griffin to teach him. Griffin agreed, if only to prove that he was right. For many weeks, Griffin and Neeto trained near nightly to cast the most basic spells. However, one night, after a long night of failures, and not-so-passive aggression from Griffin, Neeto had enough. Frustrated, he yelled a string of insults at his teifling companion, channeling his rage and mixing it with flowery speech borrowing from his many stories. Much to his surprise, the sorcerer stumbled backwards and clutched his head, looking dazed. Neeto stood uneasy, as a look of shock, and then a slow smile spread across his friend's face. \"You did it\" he said, looking up and chuckling. \"You actually did it\".   After a few more days of practice, Neeto learned to channel his words into magic, stunning opponents, empowering allies, and even winning over skeptics. He learned to weave words that could bring an audience's imagination to life, deceiving their eyes and presenting a convincing illusion. He crafted masterful jokes that would seize the mind of it's target, trapping them in uncontrollable laughter. His words could embolden anyone, make them more charismatic, or stronger, or even a little bit smarter. He reached new heights as a con man, and practiced his magic whenever he could. This led to many failures and a lot of narrow escapes, much to Griffin's annoyance, but the duo managed to do well, and eventually found themselves living relatively lavishly for a pair of vagabond criminals. They traveled to the city of Priencia, where they set up a con as the fictional Duke of Everhollow. The duo managed to scam a not insignificant amount of money from the citizens of the city, but a few more missteps necessitated a hasty exit. Neeto and Griffin decided to set sail to the city of Certosa, to the north, contracting out a small shipping boat with a handful of other guests. It was on this voyage that Griffin and Neeto discovered a powerful cube, and, on promise of money by a mysterious scholar, set out on a journey to unlock the secrets of its shrines.  "}]}

I’ve learned a few things about staying alive and taking others before they get me.  My family thinks I’m crazy and I’m sure they’ve long sense washed their hands of me.  I’m not worried as when I left there were 10 others and ma was due any day.  They all liked the farm and didn’t mind doing the same thing day after day.  I couldn’t stand it.  I always knew there was adventure and treasure and all kinds of things out there that I just couldn’t get out of that stupid little dirt farm.  I stuck it out as long as I could but my nature was always getting me in trouble.  One day I’d heard ”You’ll live by my rules and earn your keep as long as you’re under my roof” once to often.  I walked out right in the middle of the lecture and only stopped long enough to grab the stuff I’d been stashing against such a day.  That was my 13th birthday and I haven’t been back sense.  As far as I know they are still there doing the same things as they were doing when I left except I’m sure there are alot more of them by now.  I hooked up for a while with a group of bandits but soon realized I’d be better off elsewhere.   It wasn’t just that they weren’t very skilled, they were just down right stupid.   I stole their stuff right from under the leader’s nose while he was asleep and spent 2 days putting as much distance as I could between us.  2 weeks later they were completely wiped out by some group of mercs that were hired by the locals to end their petty tyrany.  I hooked up with a traveling band of entertainers next.  They were a fun bunch of people.  By the time we hit the 3rd town I had proof of what I’d started to suspect on the 1st.  There were certain members of the team with extremely useful tricks that they practiced to benefit the whole troop.  I mean this troop cleared a very hefty profit that had nothing to do with entertainment rewards.  When I confronted one of them and gave him a choice, I could turn them in or he could teach me all he knew.  This highly amused him and he decided to take me up on the offer.  I spent the next  6 years learning my trade.  Not only the fine art of  lifting the things that I knew would be put to better use by me.  They also taught me the fine art of eliminating peoples’ problems in a permanent way for an appropriate, some might say exorbiant, price.  However you get what you pay for.  Permanent solutions aren’t cheap.  I was a wild card that no one would look at twice.  I always had a cover, after all who would suspect a seemingly child jester of being in reality a master assasin?   My professional handle is Death Rattle and I became well known in certain circles as being very efficient.  I finally decided to strike out on my own as the whole entertainment thing was wearing thin.  We parted on good terms and it was agreed that we would keep in touch professionally.  I  would continue to take jobs and make contacts thru their network and they would take 10% of all jobs that went thru them ( while I traveled with the troop I only made 60% as the other 40% went to the troops profit/operating expence fund).  However I would travel across the country on my own to find new adventures as well.  By this time I could take the jobs that interested me and ignore the rest.  I was welcome to return any time I got tired of adventuring on my own.   Once again I set out to find adventure, only this time I was much better supplied.  I had a 1,000 ilb bag of holding and enough trail rations for 2 mos.   As well as a decent weapon and armor, enough platinum, gold and gems to last for awhile.  The rest of my earnings were invested in the troop’s investments.  I’m determined not to touch those though.  The longer they stay there the more they earn.      - I found a big castle to wander in.  There were some promising hits, but I ended up teleported to Shadowdale.  I hooked up w/ another halfling (or rather he hooked up w/ me).  He took me to a magick store where I priced things out.  The useful stuff was 1,000 GP and up.  Cisreal was interesting and told some wild tales.  Well we wondered  around town and I spent the night at a good Inn and I plan on working tomorrow.  -Every one was talking about some commotion about a male/female, there are several differing stories about that.  Anyway it was a new student that had a duel of somesort at the magic college.  He/She ended up as a Female.  Working around I freed several GP from a fat merchant.  Then as I made my way thru town and a came across a fat purse just sitting on the ground behind a thug.  I just couldn't pass up the oppurtunity and I got the purse w/o any problems.  As I went by I noticed that the interesting group that I followed here was having some sort of confrontation.  I decided to double back and check things out.  That's when I noticed the thug was wearing several magical items.  I decided to relieve him of at least one of them.  However he didn't appear amused, even when I flashed him a grin.  He drew his sword and I decided to tumble threw the frey.  I took refuge under a table that a kid was sitting at.  The fighters took out  the thugs and I managed to stay unharmed by it.  -I decided the area was one worth sticking around in for a while.  There were alot of possibilities around here for sure.  There isn't even much of a theives guild in this city.  Now that's a crying shame.  I guess I'll just have to take advantage of it.    -I was contacted thru my old friends for a fairly easy job.  It only took 2 wks to set up and it was done in a permanent sorta way.  I got my gold and sent them their's.  I spent most of the last 2 months wandering around and doing some light work.  I am after all far more curious about new surroundings than anything else.  All in all I've made just under 1,000 gp for the past 2 months.  That includes my old friends' cut.   I watched the group I came here with as well.  They are not to bad.  One of them pretends he's royalty and eats anything that is not tied down.  The kid is the brain of that particular bunch.  The paladin is far more interested in learning fighting than anything else.  Typical for that breed.  The one magic user is still female although she looks like she switched heads or something.  The other magic user has some comfort, useful magic in a day to day way.  He just doesn't have real powerful combat stuff from what I've seen.   Although he excels at annoying the fuck out of everyone else.  The other halfling fits in as well.  Usually he bears the brunt of the jokes from the one magic user, and tries to protect the kid from the Royal Pretender.  All in all the dynamics are amusing to watch.  I have no idea why they stick together but they do.    -I was approached and told to go to the inn for another briefing.  They said it would definately be profitable though.  This contact came straight to me and not thru my old friends.  I guess I'm getting a reputation on my own now.  Interesting what some profitable working can do.  I went, and was told the price is 2,000 gp up front and 8,000 gp ea when we are done.  It sounds like it would be fun anyway as it involves planeshifting.  Something I've only done when I got here.  Did I mention the weird group is hired as well?  We are all going to Kalamar, to a city called Thycasha.  There is a sage there we have to go see.  Apparently, some archeologist known as Mad Raddock borrowed 100,000 gp and started giving it away to everyone but the owners.  He was trying to find the \"Orb of Midnight\".  According to the sage, there are actually 2 pieces that make up the Orb.  The local Temple of Nightmares or something like that is after it as well.  Their symbol is a full moon w/an open eye in it.  I will definately keep my eyes open for the symbol and stay away from the anyone who has anything to do with it.  If we are indeed after the same thing  they are probably more than willing to slit the throat  of anyone who gets in there way.  Holy Fanactics, there is no one crazier in all the planes.  The sage said he could draw us a map and we agreed to wait the 2 days and pay the 500 gp for a very fine, very detailed map.  I will try to get ahold of it before all things are said and done.  Unfortuneately the other halfling is the groups map carrier.  That  will work as long as I get it when we are done.  While we were waiting on the map, we decided to check out the town and see what was to be had.  I found a Ring of Protection +1, that I decided to splurge on.  The Royal Pretender placed a 800 gp price on the head of one the mage's familiar.  It was tempting but I know better than to fuck w/ a mage's familiar.  Someone else didn't know better and killed it with several ice blasts.  I looked around but nothing else caught my fancy.  A really stupid thief tried to make off w/ my belt pouch but he was very unlucky.  I grabbed his wrist and asked him \"Don't you know better then to try that on someone else in the trade?\" He just kinda panicked and said \"Let me go!\"  I told him I would as soon as he removed his hand from my pouch.  He dropped my pouch like a hot potatoe and took off like the hounds of hell were after him.  If he is an example of the local talent, I'm not to impressed.  Although from the looks of things with the amount of guards all over you gotta give him credit for trying.  Any way the next 2 days were fairly uneventful.  The mage is mad and the Royal Pretender is carrying around the iceball remains of familiar it cost him 800 gp to have killed.  The other halfling was forced to find stabling for his mount as there is no way the beast can take the heat of the desert.  To bad, it seemed like a nice St. Bernard.  I believe that everyone in the group but me is dead broke now.  Some items that looked interesting but I couldn't afford were, Flask of Endless H20 (5,000 gp) ring of protection against the elements +5 (1,500 gp).  Maybe when we get back I'll pick them up.  I'm trying to decide what else would be useful besides a bag of holding 5,000 ilbs.  I think I may try to find one of those stone mounts that go back and forth from stone to flesh.  Maybe a bear or a cat of some kind.  I know that my dreams are becoming very interesting.  They are featuring me casually flinging magic about like a sorceror, sometimes I even have a ethereal type monkey on my shoulder.  Other times I'm actually holding a conversation with the monkey.  I'm not sure why I've been dreaming these but they seem unusual to say the least.  I'll have to talk to the spellcasters and see if I can figure out where they are coming from. They may just be part of this place, but they seem almost familiar, as if I've dreamed them before and just not remembered the dreams when I woke up.  We finally got the map from the sage and set out immediately.  At the end of the first day we voted to travel at night instead of daylight though.  This is my first experience with the desert.  I would much rather sleep thru the heat of the day whenever possible.  We came across a strange person, almost naked who apparently lived off the blood of vultures.  Better vultures than halflings, but he was still pretty weird.  I kept my distance, and was releived to leave him behind as we continued our trip.  At the rate we are traveling it will take a total of 7 days to reach our destination.  At least we don't have to cross the hills as well.  We've been staying the night in some sort of magical fort that protects from the elements put up by the mage that lost his familiar.  He seems a fairly good sport about it so far though.  I don't think I would be in his shoes but to each his own.  We came across some people looking for lost mines and found out that there are actually quite a few people populating the desert.  Several groups/singles have passed by with the moon/eye symbol as well.  I am definately still keeping and eye out for them.  We have only had 3 instances where we were troubled by creatures out to do us harm.  In all 3 cases the monsters were stopped w/o my direct help.  I must admit I'm pleased with the groups determination to totally annihalate anything in their way.  The one arrow that I managed to get off completely missed the Manticore.  The rest were dead by the time I loaded my cross-bow.  That makes me feel better for their survival when we get to the pyramid we are looking for.  We came across the Pyramid at the end of the 7th night.  We did a basic look around but decided to enter tomorrow when the whole group was fresh.  I can't wait until then as then we will be in my element.  I'm getting a good night's sleep as tomorrow the real fun begins.  I hope we find a bunch of gems and stuff.  Wouldn't it be cool if we found some enspelled gems as well.  They would be worth a bundle to the right market.  Most of the time people don't even think of it though.   "}]}

She would often mimic the exercises performed by both the dragons and her elders, mastering them after no more than a casual glance. Houjin recognised hers as a mind with the  potential for nearly limitless growth, so she was taken on as a student. Oona quickly mastered not only the exercises but the draconic language itself. But as Oona grew, she began to feel restless. She had a longing, although she was unable to identify what for and she started to question whether or not Houjin truly knew all the answers to the questions of life. When Oona achieved the status of Master, she cared more for the autonomy of the position than the honour. With her newly gained access, he spent many a day alone, exploring the deepest and dustiest cavities in the sanctuaries, slowly piecing together clues that illuminated the forbidden past. Her peer yet competitor, Yashin, warned her of the danger in seeking out knowledge without the dragonlord's permission, but Oona saw no harm in research; besides, something has never felt right in the histories. She discovered the truth of Faerun's past; it was not always a world ruled and feared by dragons as the teachings of Houjin claimed. At one time, humanoid 'Khans' led mighty clans that dominated the land unopposed. Oona also learned legend of a powerful spirit dragon, Tatsuo, from whom all dragons were formed. She felt drawn to find Tatsuo, believing he could quench her longing for clarity. Eventually she was discovered, confronted and ousted by Yashin, who had hoped to use her downfall to further his own stature. Oona managed to overpower and disfigure him then made her escape but was labeled as a heretic to be killed on sight. So, she then set out into Faerun as a Chronicler on a sojourn of discovery."}]}

He was the middle child of 6 children, three older brothers, one younger brother, and one younger sister. His three brothers, adept magic wielders themselves, were already employed as guardsmen. Araniel focused most on learning magic, but was also trained to become a soldier. He?s the same age as the prince, and because his parents are so high class he actually grew up being friends with the prince, who gave Araniel a lot of really expensive gifts, jewelry in particular. This sparked Araniel?s interest in precious stones, especially when his siblings started getting jealous of his friendship with the prince. It made him feel unique in his very large family. His parents were humble despite their high status and they disliked all the gifts, forcing Araniel to return them, but he kept a ring that remains a special token of his friendship with the prince.   Years later, their land was brutally attacked and Araniel fought for the first time. In doing so, he watched his boyfriend and one of his older brothers die, and another get his arm cut off, which traumatized Araniel and made him realize he couldn?t be a soldier for the rest of his life. In confiding with his friend, the prince suggested Araniel become a royal precious stonesmith, Which Araniel was very enthusiastic about, and the prince introduced him to a local jeweler. There, Araniel began to neglect both his guardsman duties and magic studies to learn the art of jewelry making, which his parents eventually had to come to terms with when they realized how happy he was. He?s still technically just an apprentice stonesmith and technically still officially employed as a guardsman, but he periodically takes long expeditions to discover new precious stones/metals. Because he?s dabbled in so many skills, magic, fighting, and artisan, he?s trying to prove he can become truly proficient in one thing for the rest of his life, and he wants that one thing to be jewelry making.

Her parents Carric and Enna, while present, were distant, more prone to wandering the streets of the city and engaging with the community, than spending time with their daughter. By the age of thirty she already felt the wanderlust that plagues her race and her parents apprenticed her to a venerable Bard, local, and a friend of the family, so as to learn his trade. Morwen showed little aptitude for music, though excelled at story telling, making even the most outrageous tales ring with truth. After ten years of learning, her Master unexpectedly died, (old age takes its toll even on Elves, eventually) leaving Morwen without a mentor, and with an incomplete bardic skill set.  She returned to her parents’ home, heartbroken, lost, and still longing for the freedom that the walls of Evereska could never give her. Rather than find Morwen another mentor, Enna convinced Carric to allow Morwen to choose her own form of study, whether that meant continuing the Bard’s path, or another. Morwen was unsure, and after a few more years of general study she discovered a lesser deity that she had never been taught of before: Fenmarel Mestarine, the lesser deity of outcasts.   In her research she found a connection to the deity, and discovered her own ways to give praise, seeking out lonely corners of the city, abandoned buildings and underground gambling circles that those yet to reach adulthood weren’t meant to see. She found a skill at hiding, at sneaking and sliding through shadows, unseen by many around her. It was only when she was caught that she found her true calling.   Faleas Stagswift was his name, and he was also in the shadows. It was in the process of a planned assassination that Morwen got in his way, and rather than kill her for the inconvenience, he was convinced to teach her his ways. It wasn’t easy, and Morwen never was more grateful for the old Bard’s teaching than when she told Faleas her life’s story. The story was full of lies, of course, and by the time Morwen finished talking she had Faleas convinced that she was an orphan, escaped from a dangerous caretaker, and not only in dire need of his assistance, but also an apt learner for his skills.   Morwen did not return to her family’s home except once, to retrieve what little belongings she felt were truly hers. Her parents were not home. She didn’t really wonder if they would miss her, and she felt, truly, that they wouldn’t really notice she had gone. Faleas didn’t so much raise her, as he did tolerate her presence and allow her to observe. She found a home in the taverns they circulated between, loving the smells of cooking meats and drunken gambling around her.   She was nearly seventy by the time they first ventured from Evereska into the Vine Vale and the Greycloak Hills below, trading odds and ends and scraps of information for anything they could get. There weren’t many people in the surrounding hills, and they often ventured back into Evereska when supplies ran low, or opportunities for wealth waned. Throughout this time Morwen learned that, more than danger, Faleas traded in information, and that information could be the most dangerous tool of all. She vowed to never tell a truth about herself if she could help it, because if an enemy didn’t know you, they couldn’t beat you.   Morwen learned more than a little skill with bow and blade through hunting in the hills, but Faleas never asked for her assistance in the messier of his contracts, nor did he allow her to follow him. It was on those nights alone that Morwen would consider her life, her choices, and what those would mean for her once she was old enough to leave.  When she was nearing her ninetieth year she began running cons of her own, independent of Faleas and his contracts. She never lost the skills the old Bard taught her, and she found it was much easier to convince someone that she was worthy of trust, than to prove that worthiness with her actions. Disguises became her fare, and it was not uncommon for her to see how many times she could meet a single tavern patron in one night before they caught wind of the ruse.   It was also around this time when they first starting hearing tales of a wanted man and his young apprentice, sought in connection with a dozen murders and two dozen burglaries, with descriptions eerily similar to that of Faleas and herself. Descriptions of her were always vague and quite often glaringly inaccurate, but it was the first time Morwen felt more fear than exhilaration when someone looked at them twice in a shady tavern.   Faleas, much older and blindingly secure in his skills, didn’t fear their bounty and continued his work with a tiresome pace. Morwen did not know if he was losing his touch, or perhaps it was simply a string of bad luck, but shortly before her hundredth year, Faleas was arrested and immediately sentenced to prison. She never found out how long his sentence was determined to be, but from every bit of gossip she could gather, they never found Faleas’ mystery apprentice, and the man denied her very presence.   On her own for the first time in her life, and nearing what most elves would consider “adulthood”, Morwen began to travel more extensively. Her cons didn’t work at every tavern, but she found it was easy to play a new role in every town, even without the hassle of disguising her face. She found entertainment and company in many a pub from Evereska’s surrounding hills, to the high moors, to the very outskirts of Waterdeep.   One of the easiest cons, she learned, was what words to say to convince an attractive stranger to share your bed. She enjoyed the company of every person she conned this way, and though none knew her true name, she had to admit, she fell a little bit in love with each and every one. She felt as if there were infinite parts of her heart, already shattered from too much distance, that she left with each of her lovers, a memory of her presence being perhaps the only true thing about their time together. It didn’t bother her, but the idea that perhaps someone would demand more of her, pieces of her heart that she wasn’t willing to give, and that she would be unable to stop it, worried at the back of her mind.   She continued this con, and many others, traveling far and wide across the Faerun countryside. She rarely used the same name twice, and never the name she was raised with. Each evening she offered prayers to Fenmarel Mestarine, and embraced the life of an outcast that she had chosen to live, and each morning she moved on, town to town, city to city. She did not live uncomfortably, and her skill with both secrecy and deception gave her a certain leg up in games of cards that relied on more than chance, allowing her to earn an income with very little of what a common man would consider “work”.    There were many romances that lasted more than a night, many lovers staying at her side for months or even years at a time. She loved them all, though did not mourn their choice to leave, respecting their freedom to travel and love as they wish, just as she would like to be respected. She encountered, laughed and fought and drank, with those of every race, including a fateful encounter with a drow, who strayed near the surface one night when Morwen was alone.   The drow female was alone, looking paranoid and scared of the very moon in the sky, but not so evil as she had been raised to believe. They didn’t share a language, but in their brief exchange they found the word for Fenmarel Mestarine, the lone wolf, was the same, and they found a brief kinship in their worship. The drow, most likely having had her fill of the surface, retreated into the cave from whence she came, but Morwen left changed by the experience, and half wishing she had a reason to adventure into the underdark to see what she could learn.   It is this life of adventure-- scam, travel, and entertainment, that Morwen has chosen for herself, and though she sometimes longs for more, a deeper purpose beyond her current learning, she’s content in her place.

Like her father Grier and her older brother Harris, it was expected that she would work the sawmill when she was old enough. But the traces of magic that ran in her family surfaced at a young age. Grier, who thought magic was the stuff of \"nobles and time-wasters who don't do honest work\", was opposed to her receiving training, but her mother Iona wrote in secret to the House of Mysteries, one of the most renown schools of Arcana in the world.  Though unhappy, Grier eventually agreed that Màiri's gifts needed honing. Her magic was uncontrolled by her own poor understanding of exactly what she was capable of. Untrained, she might even have been dangerous to have around. So she left Kelness and her family and started her residence in the House of Mysteries.   The training was hard, particularly because some of the Senior Arcanists barely bothered to teach her, forcing her to learn a great deal on her own just to keep up. These teachers felt that a Dwarf from a poor family would never truly be capable of measuring up to other mages. Màiri intended to prove them wrong. She worked tirelessly, often falling asleep in the libraries and needing to be carried back to her bed.  During one of these late library sessions in her second year, she met another student who was struggling. Zaia Aster was an Elf from a prominent magical family who was also struggling with the expectations of her teachers. In her case, they were impossibly high due to her family's fame. She and Màiri agreed to help each other, and after a great many long nights studying and practicing together, both realized that they had fallen in love.  Sadly, fate intervened in their happiness two years later. Both had progressed in their studies to more than satisfactory levels, and were about to graduate to Junior Arcanists and be given field assignments. Days before the ceremony, a letter arrived from Zaia's parents. They had arranged a marriage for her, to a man from a house of great standing. All of Zaia's protests fell on deaf ears. The wedding would go ahead as planned. So Màiri was forced to part with her, but not before Zaia gave her an Elven sword and a promise that she would always love her.   The graduation was a more somber affair than Màiri had expected, but the promise of getting to go out into the world as an official representative of the House of Mysteries lifted her spirits a little. She vowed that she would work harder than ever, that she would do her teachers, her family, and everyone else proud. And that one day, maybe, she and Zaia would meet again."}]}

He was known to take an ~interest~ in his female household staff, and he took an interest in late blooming Jada when she was 18. He essentially took advantage of her for 2 years, longer than any of his other victims. At 20, she took an interest in someone else. Two someone elses: a pair of siblings. The brother worked as a stablehand, the sister was a maid too, and Jada was pretty infatuated with the both of them, though she never acted on it. All the same, the lord took notice. Had them both quietly killed and showed Jada their bodies. That was the breaking point. She acted super docile and broken for the next week (which wasn't too difficult), all the while amping up rebellion among the rest of the household staff. Finally, one night, she goes to his room with the knife she uses to trim the candles. After, once he's asleep, she cuts his throat. There's some serious uproar, but because literally EVERYBODY hated this guy, including any of the guards who were recruited locally, there weren't too many subsequent casualties. She was hailed as the person who finally managed to kill the lord, and the community quickly rearranged itself into a less feudal structure. With the general population now even more protective of their hard won community, they established a sort of border defense. One old ranger recruited a bunch of young people, trained them, and stationed them at outposts along their borders. Jada was first in line.

But like them, he was dogmatic and merciless and believed himself righteous above judgement. On one expedition he and his fellows came across an evil blade of the Shadowfell, which used a dark power to tempt them into seizing it. Some paladins were able to resist, but not those like Leyland, who were driven by ambition and fury instead of a righteous cause. The enthralled paladins slew their fellows, and then each other, to be the sole owner of the blade. Through luck, more than anything, Leyland triumphed and gained possession of the blade. Afterward, the madness passed and Leyland realized what he had done, but he found that the sword was bound to him and he could not discard it. Sickened by his actions and the revelation that he was not the incorruptible force for good that he had supposed, Leyland vowed to go into exile with the blade and live a life of peace.  Decades later, an ageing Leyland was forced to break this vow when a great evil threatened the land. Using the dark blade, and with the help of other adventurers, he was able to save the inhabitants of a nearby village from a group of these villains. Leyland realized that he had a chance to atone by confronting this menace, and to put the sword to a noble purpose. United with his new companions, he swore a new paladin oath - this time driven by a sincere desire to do good, although he knew he could not promise that the sword would never be able to cause him to do harm again. But he has vowed to do all the good he can, and make right any wrongs he might cause. "}]}

When Jonah was twenty, he began work on The Royal Fortune, a ship owned by a wealthy merchant Berrian Goldpetal. Jonah spent several years with this crew. He grew especially close to a Halfling named Cade Thorngage.   The crew became dissatisfied with the small amount they were being paid to transport such expensive items. They were doing the most work while Goldpetal made by far the most money. Their anger was egged on by Cade and eventually culminated in a mutiny in which Captain Ironscale was killed by Jonah.   The Royal Fortune spent over a decade as a pirate ship captained by Cade, and they terrorized a small section of sea in the south. They particularly targeted other ships owned by the Goldpetal Trading Company.  Jonah had the position of Quartermaster and commanded the ship while not in battle or actively searching for treasure.   The ship was not far from the coast when it got caught unexpectedly in a powerful storm, worse than any any of the crew had seen before. The ship was destroyed. Jonah washed up on shore, badly injured, particularly his right leg which he would eventually lose to an infection.   Jonah struggled to understand how he could have survived that storm which he assumed was a direct punishment from Melora. As far as he could tell, he was the only one that did. Jonah became convinced that Melora kept him alive for a purpose, to serve Her and atone for his past actions. As Jonah walked along the shore, collecting the few items from his old ship that had washed up, he found a ordinary looking blank book whose pages were somehow completely dry and undamaged.  "}]}

Not one to care too much for the city dwellers in the valley below, he spent most of his years communing with nature and learning the ways of the wild. That is until his 26th year. A Peryton came down from the mountains and kidnapped Trar's parents while he was in the settlement of Glasspring after just finishing guiding a group down from the mountains. Returning to his village and hearing of the deaths by the beast, Trar left on a quest for revenge. It took a year of mapping the mountains and tracking down rumors to discover the creatures lair. Roosting high in a hidden mountain forest, a mating pair and their two offspring had made a nest. Here, Trar found the remains of his parents. Flying into a rage, he killed the foul beasts without mercy. Taking a trophy from the creature, a stag horn from the head of the beast, he set up a home in the forest to mourn the loss of his parents and commune with nature.

Though the Order of Al’Asran itself is secular, members are not required to be non-religious. The Order of Al’Asran was founded by the nobles of Trezna, who created it as a means to an end in order to eliminate the lich Xanaphia Siannodel. However, Xanaphia is well-protected by the people, and so the Order has yet to confront her at all. Most of the tireless efforts of the Order have only gone toward destroying minor undead in the area.  Eris was raised within the Order, and her speed and dexterity made her a fine candidate to be trained beside scouts and rangers. Before she was old enough to begin her class training Eris developed a passion for dance, and that passion heavily influenced her goals for her career – she has known that she wanted to be a dervish, just like some of the quickest and most cunning combatants in the Order, since she was a child.  Eris left Trezna two years before she met The Raiders of the Forsaken Dragon on the aisle of Zegara. She has been traveling, with the Order’s blessing, to broaden her experiences so that she may return with the power and wisdom to bring down Xanaphia once and for all. She was drawn to Keshiki four months before meeting The Raiders, and has spent the last two months in Zegara completing quests for the Zegaran Adventurer’s Guild to increase her skills and acquire the funds to buy new equipment.

(Their father was one of the best musicians in the city who specialized in esoteric forms too obscure to ever achieve much financial success, but made a comfortable living playing for festivals.)

Razalas happened to learn that Lord Frath, a minor scion of the noble Belt family, had conspired to cheat members of the Drovers and Teamsters Guild out of their due payment for a delivery. In their attempts to redress this grievance, their investigation eventually revealed a plot involving arms smuggling, infiltration by the Red Wizards of Thay, and fiendish corruption of several nobles and government officials in the Gate region. This drew the attention of the Harpers and left Razalas now unsuited for the stuffy confines of academia. While their lack of guile would ensure Razalas would never be a master of spycraft, the Harpers were impressed with their zeal and talent for investigation, as well as their considerable arcane prowess.

Because of Evelynn’s talent, she was often allowed to accompany the priests on short missionary trips outside the city walls, where she helped to spread the word of Pelor and gave succor to those in need.

She began attending services at other temples in Brindol with the hopes of finding a new god or goddess to dedicate herself to, but was unable to identify with any of their teachings.  It wasn’t until Mezzo exposed her to the tenets of the Raven Queen and Evelynn realized she knew the cold hand of fate firsthand that she found her true calling in life.  Believing that everything is predetermined and that circumstances occur in order to guide her throughout her life, Evelynn fled Brindol with her brother after his troubles with the law.

After several years growing up in town as a normal child should, Elise was no longer recognizable as the scared, malnourished youth that had taken shelter with the church of Ilmater in Eltabbar.

Upon Elise’s sixteenth birthday, both L’eric and Erin were pleased to formally accept her as an Adorned in the ranks of the Ilmatari.

It was then that Elise’s real training began.

After four years of intense instruction, Elise was given her first assignment.

Unfortunately, it was not long after they arrived that they discovered the woods were much more sinister than any they had ever seen. A darkness was creeping over the land, and soon packs of wolves twisted by dark magic prowled closer and closer to the settlement, making leaving the village next to impossible.

While tales of heroic sacrifice and impossible romance in her head, she agreed to stay in the castle forever if her father was set free, unable to comprehend what horrors awaited her. The prince of the castle was no fairytale prince, and he cared not for her attempts at kindness. She was chained to a demonic altar as a virgin sacrifice when Gaston burst in, the magnanimous hero come to save her, the damsel in distress, the very thing she'd always loathed and swore never to become. In that moment, she honestly didn't know which was worse: being sacrificed to open a portal to hell, or having to witness Gaston save her and then never shut up about it. By time he listened to her angry screams and released her, every evil thing was already dead, every mirror smashed, and there was nothing left to take out her rage on except her own psyche.

Sativa, a druid of the human race."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "C. Sativa was content with his life, living in the woods outside a village in the Southern Wildlands. They seemed inappropriately named to him, as the days passed peacefully, and saw him growing herbs and foraging for mushrooms to sell to the locals.  He kept himself to himself, but he didn’t mind that; he was happy to spend his evenings enjoying his own produce. He spent so much time in the woods there was even a rumour that he was part tree himself. When asked, he would rub unusually calloused hands together and smile slightly and ask “How would that work, then?” And if anyone asked what the C stood for in his name, he would say “secret” and no-one would pull him up on his spelling.  But he was well-liked nonetheless. If the local Baron thought that maybe the herbs Sativa sold to the villagers made them a bit… relaxed, then he turned a blind eye, since the mushrooms Sativa sold to the Baron were sure to make a party go with a bang.  One day, all that changed.  He noticed the smell first, as though an enormous bonfire had been lit nearby. At first he thought there was a party that he had forgotten about. But then he heard shouts, and they weren’t shouts of joy. He climbed a tree and looked across to the village.  The Baron’s castle was a ruin. The village was ablaze. Dead bodies were everywhere. And approaching, very close already, were dozens of bugbears wielding swords and axes and clad in rusty armour.  Bugbears run fast, and they had already seen him, and who knows how many more there were spread through the woods? It is likely the only thing which saved him was an overeager bugbear bearing a flaming torch. It grinned, and thrust the firebrand into Sativa’s latest crop. Smoke billowed. Bugbears coughed and stumbled. Even Sativa, with his high tolerance, felt faint.  Disliking violence, and with nothing to stay for, he stepped over the now-snoring bugbears and salvaged what he could - some clothes, food, and a half kilo of his finest greenery and a stock of seeds.  Now, he travels the land, hoping to find a new home. To his astonishment, few places are grateful for his skill in herb growing and mushroom gathering, and he finds himself run out of town after town.  One day, he hopes to find a place where he can be happy again."}]}

When Magenta's outer city fell into a state of civil unrest and eventually all-out war following the assassination of the king in the inner city by the visitors from another universe, Danell and his fellow kids formed a gang of child soldiers to help defend the townspeople from the royal guard, who had begun to be increasingly harsh, blaming the townspeople for the king's death.  Eventually a group of mercenary ex-artisans recruited the kids into a formal role in the war, and Danell personally helped to steal supplies from the barracks and run them to the city through the sewage lines.  In doing so, he befriended a flutemaker who happened to be a retired bard, Geo Nester, who taught Danell the basics of bardistry and even introduced him to the last surviving member of the group of outsiders.  During a particularly important raid, one member of the group of artisans betrayed the group to the guards for a paltry sum, and the children were all captured.  Just as Danell was about to be executed, Geo and a few other artisans stormed the courtyard.  They were killed within minutes, but this gave Geo and a few of the other children time to escape.  Danell was supposed to meet up with the others, but he instead ran back to try to at least bury Geo's body — only to find it had already been fed to the wild animals.  He went back to the spot where they were supposed to meet, but nobody was there.  The gang of child soldiers was no more.  Some consolation could be found, however, in the fact that their “side” of the revolution, spearheaded by a relatively small religious group, did end up winning.  After the city settled into order, renaming itself Fuchsia and forbidding any mention of Magenta, Danell was eventually recruited to the new city watch, where he worked to protect the citizens.  He would use his position to help out those less fortunate, and while not a major political player, was a member of a political organization devoted to easing the burden off the lower classes (so as to prevent another civil war).

He honed his ability to drive wagons and cook. He also picked up some of the Halfling language from the friendly folk that accompanied him.  After a particularly bloody battle, Ander was pulled from the teamsters to fill a gap in the line. Despite his easy going demeanor and less than average intelligence, he became an adept spearman and would continue to serve in the line for several years.

After mustering out, returning home was Ander's goal. Unfortunately, being from an unnamed village and lacking the ability to read made for a difficult return journey.

When war came to Thaver, both Avric and his elder brother Felix joined the army, Avric as a footsoldier, Felix, who was more intellectually gifted, as a Lieutenant. The war lasted for 6 years, and when it was over, Thaver was defeated. There wasn't much glory or use for the defeated soldiers in a lost war, so Avric was left to serve as a day laborer in the town of Parrick. He could not afford a house, so he rented a room in the inn. He was a jovial sort, and managed to brighten the common room with his presence, which the innkeepers appreciated. He wrote to his brother often. After a couple years, however, a new road was made in Thaver, and traders passed less and less through Parrick. With fewer traders, the wages of a laborer grew less and less. He stopped responding to his brother's letters. Eventually, the jobs became scarce and Avric fell unemployed, and soon thereafter, homeless. During a rainstorm, Avric broke into the local temple for shelter and a place to sleep. Come morning, the Priest saw him and took pity on him, and hired him to work around the temple, and offered him lodgings and food. Avric never was much for religion, especially after the war, but the priest's kindness inspired something in him, and he devoted himself to caring for the temple. About a year later, the priest died and a new priest was brought in to shepherd the town. The new priest was not fond of Avric and threw him to the streets. Angry that his devotion was rewarded with such an injustice, Avric once again broke into the temple, and the new priest called the guards on him. He was arrested and sent to the regional prison, where he was cellmates with a halfling Jonn. Avric was a man of great stature, and as such he required more food than the prisoners' allowance. Jonn, as a halfling, did not need as much, and was inclined to share his meals. The two became friends soonafter. Five years into his imprisonment, there was a riot at the prison. Avric decided not to take part in it, but Jonn was killed in the battle. From then on Avric became much more solitary and cut off from the world. At the end of his ten year prison sentence, Avric was a broken man. He had no wealth to his name and a lifetime of weariness.

Bronze Fury is young, rash, and thirsting for glory. A compact young man, wandering to prove himself, he comes from a proud race, the people of the dragon. They live on sere and rocky land, the northern face of Naemara's central mountain range.  They make a yearly trek up and down the north-western coast of Naemara. His war pick is really a native weapon, used for climbing, digging, and killing. Bronze Fury carries a chip on his shoulder. People do not like him when he's angry.   Bronze Fury longs for the simpler time of his heroes, brave warriors of the tribe who defeated their enemies and protected their clan. These days his matriarchal society emphasizes trade and the precepts of society. Even the men, traditionally raised for an ordered defense of the tribe or foraging sorties into the jungle now end up fishing and gathering more than the women. So Bronze Fury takes his strength and his pride and strikes out his own path, as did the heroes of legends. He knows he will have a special place in his clan's history, he must first prove himself out in the world. Bronze Fury seeks renown and glory.   The old stories tell of dragons, or at least one dragon, who patronized the People of the Dragon, visiting its rulership from across the sea. In a lot of ways the tribe of today reflects the ancient one subservient to the dragons: they are a LG nomadic tribe of ~200 humans that migrate between the frigid north then down south and west to the sea, staying in the foothills. They have close ties to the dwarves found under these mountains. The more mystically-inclined seek out the Renmul wood elves to learn their craft.   The People of the Dragon used to be thought of as barbarians by the humans who inhabit the fishing villages of the coast and the outposts in the mountains, though in the last century they have gained some acceptance. This has been an active pursuit of the People, as they moved to adopt more modern ways. Some families have even settled permanently and taken up agriculture.   Historically, the People have used the phrase \"seeking a dragon\" literally to mean searching for a dragon guardian for wisdom and guidance. Nowadays the phrase has a derogatory connotation, and refers to when a young tribesman does not agree with the Mothers, sometimes striking off to forge their own way. But in Bronze Fury's great-grandmother's stories to \"seek a dragon\" is to go find find yourself and prove your bravery. This is what Bronze Fury plans to do. "}]}

The child was their illegitimate child born out of wedlock, and now that Sabira had birthed her, Sabira wanted nothing to do with her or with Aseir.  Aesir took their child, and named her Vaalia. Unlike the mother of his child, he was instantly smitten with her, and vowed she would have a happy life.  Vaalia had a happy, but mediocre upbringing, with her father rising through the guild artisan ranks to become a high-ranking guild artisan. Vaalia, however, had no interest in the world of the artisans, and found herself drawn to the arcane.  Encouraging her scholarly pursuits, Aesir sought out a kindly wizard for her to study under. She was sent to live in the neighbouring town, under the tutelage of the wizard, away from her father, though they wrote often.  Whilst she enjoyed and excelled in the scholarly aspects of her apprenticeship, and became fast friends with his other apprentice, she was dismayed to learn that her own magical capabilities were non-existent. The wizard, kind as he was, could do nothing to help her use magic. When Vaalia received news that her father was ill, the wizard sent her home with a potion to cure him, and the grave news that perhaps she was never meant to use magic.  Distressed, she travelled back through the woods to her home town. She carried the potion, and some food in a basket, with the wizard assuring that he would send on the rest of her belongings in the morning, when they could arrange a cart and protection for it.  In her haste and the dimming light of the setting sun, Vaalia tripped over a root, breaking her basket and along with it, the potion with the cure. As she watched all the potion sink into the ground, forever lost to her, a stranger appeared. A seemingly kind fellow, he offered to help her in exchange for some favours. The man offered his hand, seemingly to help her up, and as she took it he gave her a sly grin that revealed his arch fey nature. As she felt new magic course through her, she realised that she unwittingly entered into a pact with a fey.  When he withdrew her hand, she was left with a small crystal in her palm, and an empty forest.  When Vaalia made it home, she administered her father’s potion, and he made a swift recovery. She stayed for some time to care for him, but eventually the time came for Vaalia to leave her home town and strike out into the world to see what else she could learn about magic, warlock pacts and the fey.

Her father was a blacksmith and her mother a leatherworker. She spent the majority of her childhood either in her fathers shop, watching the forge fire or out playing in the woods with her best friend Loric. As she got older she became fascinated with fire, getting in trouble frequently for setting fires, though she was always careful not to let them damage other people’s property or harm anyone. Soon she discovered she had a spark for magic, able to perform small tricks and start small flames with a click of her finger. The only person she shared this secret with was her friend Loric, now grown up somewhat into a handsome young man.

Loric worked with Nyiah’s father as an apprentice blacksmith while Nyiah worked as a washerwoman to save up for a house. Soon she fell pregnant, and the couple moved into a house a few months before she gave birth to a child she named Emma. She continued working to provide for her daughter and the three of them lived happily together.   A year later she was pregnant again and she hoped for a boy. One day as she was delivering a load of clean washing to her neighbour she heard a cry of alarm come from the towns edge and turned to see the sky turning red and grey from flames and smoke. Throwing the clothes to the ground she ran towards her house. As she approached, her worst fears were realised. Her house stood aflame, surrounded by bandits carrying torches and wicked axes. She screamed and threw fire before dashing inside with no fear for her own safety. “Emma! Loric!” Inside she found her parents, consumed by flame, ignoring the flames licking her skins she rushed back outside in time to see Loric being cut down by a bandit as her daughter screamed.

Nyiah was consumed with rage and the flames around her swelled to cover her body, lashing out, she sent waves of fire through the entire town, incinerating townsfolk and bandits alike, when she came too nothing but ash and bones remained. Feeling a great pain in her stomach she looked down to find her legs covered in blood, an arrow imbedded in her belly and her unborn child miscarried.

Ezen grew up in the town of Holden in The Ever Reaching Rise, an area of very tall, snowy, and secluded, mountains in the north. His family had moved there before he was born seeking a close-knit community away from the bustle and trouble of the rest of the world.   Ezen and his family found a home there. Ezen, and he grew up, began to take interest in Rummiara, the town Magic College.

He lives alone near the top of the mountain now, not many know his address, and no one has ever delivered mail. He runs down the 161 stairs of his perfectly round mage tower to pick up the letter.  It reads: \"Ezen, I remember when you were so excited for magic and i hope you haven't dulled in your curiosity in your old age as some of my colleagues have. If you're up for some adventure, we at the college think we've located an object you may be very interested in. The Frozen Star. We don't know much expect that it's an object capable of near limitless power in the area of Evocation, and especially cold and ice. We at the college can't pursue it, either because we're either teaching students or are too lazy! If you find it, come drop by and show us.\"  The letter was signed, \"Fargrim\". Fargrim was the most scholarly dwarf Ezen had ever met, and was his Evocation professor at the college. Fargrim was like Ezen's second father. He'd be about 250 now. The letter also contained a map with a circle around the area they believed The Star was.  Overjoyed at this information, Ezen let out an excited YA-HOO. He's been looking for a reason to get out and quest, test out all his research, and an artifact of cold? what could be better?  He grabbed as much adventuring supplies as he could stuff in his backpack along with his leather-bound spellbook that had a quite ornate snowflake on the front.

She took naturally to wizardry, but her extraplanar interests confounded her tutors. So, she began to consort not (particularly) with dark powers, but with strange powers - many who speak dead tongues or live deep beneath the sea. Her behavior as of late has led to a certain amount of estrangement from her family. Her parents believe that Alicia's experimentations are having an adverse affect on her health and sanity, and have curtly refused to fund them any further. The relationship between Alicia and her parents is further complicated by the fact that Alicia’s elder sister, Esme Merideth de Luna, has recently pledged herself to serve the church of Cyndor as a paladin, renouncing her claim to the title of Contessa...which will now, unexpectedly, fall to Alicia.  Alicia is undaunted. She considers herself bohemian, and cares little for any law but her own - including the natural laws of the prime material plane. She respects that others maintain and act upon their own beliefs, however, and does not court conflict with them - to each their own. She has an extensive correspondence with experts in a variety of fields, from diverse backgrounds with wide-ranging philosophical views. With them she is known (often under a pseudonym) as an expert in history, spellcraft, and the arcane - and most especially, of the planes. She quotes often from her readings, and has published a small number of well-regarded monographs, one of which has been censored by three churches - a fact of which she is quietly proud.  Alicia is surprisingly well kempt for someone so distracted from the mundane, an appearance she maintains with cantrips out of habit. She has light brown skin that seems paler than it ought to, and fine features. Though petite, her breeding and training have gifted her with what actors call “presence”. She is polite and generally without malice, though ruthless under provocation.  As a result of the meditations that allow her to command shadows of the denizens of alien planes, she has somewhat rearranged the furniture in her head, and her affect is subtly askew. (To give one small example, she has not yawned in over eleven years.) She tends to unnerve people, a fact which she is aware of - and unashamed of! - though she will make an effort to compensate for it if circumstances demand it. She is a talented liar, but only for advantage - she does not lie reflexively, or to toy with others. Her sense of humor is...unique.  Her right eye is bright blue with an unusually small pupil; the left is charcoal grey; dark enough that it’s often difficult to tell where the pupil begins. (This is a physical consequence of her budding transcendence).  When she wants to, she can become the nightmare image of the craftily and capriciously mad gentry. Lately that also seems to happen when she is short on sleep or abstracted."}]}

We were prepared to kick more ass than a Taiwanese donkey trainer, but when we got there we were ambushed. They had hidden their numbers, and planned to swarm us. My entire group was decimated. I saw my best friend die in front of my very eyes.   At that very moment, just as I charged in with my fist held high, something happened. Suddenly, I was struck by lightning, bitten by a radioactive rattlesnake, bombarded with gamma rays, and set on fire.   Also my parents died.  I blacked out harder than a drunken dwarf. When I woke up, I was standing on the top of a mountain. I was surrounded by the souls of dozens of kung-fu masters. They told me I was the spirit-descendant of the greatest martial artist of all time, and I was destined to carry on his incredible legacy. They used their ki to unlock a power inside me, and suddenly... I was a kung-fu master.  They sent me back to the material world, and I woke up to find a scene so horrible it would make a succubus blush. The raiders had killed everyone. Filled with righteous fury, I charged into battle, and fought for hours. They were clearly no match for my incredible powers, but they were tenacious. After dispatching the rabble, I confronted the leader. We fought hand-to-hand, mano-a-mano. Of course, I was victorious. Before he died however, he knocked over a candle and it set fire to a nearby lamp-shade. Fire engulfed the building. I know that I ran, but I barely remember what happened. Eventually, I collapsed from exhaustion.  I woke up in the courtyard, the warlord and his men were gone and I was left in the rubble.  Realizing the immense responsibility that had been placed on my shoulders, I ventured out into the world, determined to fulfill my destiny. But I knew if this was to be accomplished, I would have to change my entire life. I took a new name, and promised to tell only the closest of souls my true origin.

It was the perfect life for me..... Was.     One day, as I arrived home after a late lecture, I saw the door to my - our - house broken inward. Fearing the worst, I ran inside. All of the valuables in the house were gone. Okay. A robbery. A simple thief. A thief is there for the money, not blood, so no one was hurt, right? My Alahna must not have been home, otherwise they wouldn't have went through with it, right? I knew I was just trying to come up with a logical explanation for an unlikely outcome. As I knelt there, above who was once one the two most important things in my life, I came to a shocking realization.... Knowledge.... knowledge doesn't matter. Knowledge doesn't give power. I could guarantee that Alahna was smarter than at least half of my fellow professors. What did that get her? Nothing. It didn't protect her or give her the ability to protect herself. What use was there in knowledge when this world was dictated by violence and strength? And if there was no use for knowledge, what use was there for me?     Coming to a decision that would not, could not, be changed, I left for my office at the university. As I entered, I closed the door behind me. I had intended to end myself alongside the physical representation of the last rock in my life, my rare book collection. Looking at the tomes now, I was disgusted. I strode towards them, destructive intent that I would have thought impossible for me earlier that day was on my mind. Reaching for the shelf, my hand grasped a delicate tome.....      And I was in a different place. Looking forward, I saw my hand clasping the same book I had grabbed on my shelf. But this wasn't my shelf. I looked side to side, and saw a seemingly endless aisle stretching on either side, lined with rows upon rows of books. These shelves looked ancient, yet in pristine condition, at the same time. A voice spoke into my mind. Since that day, that has been the only time I heard that voice, and yet I cannot recall what it said. Despite this, I know what I learned. Knowledge was power. And that meant this place was power, as it was knowledge incarnate. Now I work to preserve and expand that power, if not for my own sake, then for Alahna's."}]}

His great grandfather made a pact with a demon pledging a son in exchange for his house having one hundred years of prosperity.  He was born with a brand on his hand and his birth was met with a volcanic explosion destroying his house’s lands. Further disturbing maladies and coincidences in his family have left him the last scion of a once proud house.  Distant relatives (3rd cousins) of the house Goldthorn took him in after his parents died.  They trained him in their family business as weapons merchants.  Owing to his significant skills of persuasion he was quickly able to prove his capability to pursue lucrative contracts with the guild and his adoptive family's support.  Despite his successes the leadership of the guild keep a wary eye on him due to his severe temper, especially after the incident where he nearly strangled to death a small town mayor who tried to renege on a deal with his bare hands.  His temper has always been quick but as he has gotten older he’s begun to feel power emanating from his brand.  It seems to whisper to him in his moments of passion.  After a few years of working on others behalf the perfect opportunity arose.  It was a gamble taking that large of a loan from the Goldthorns against everything he owned, but the temptation to tackle a lucrative contract on his own was too promising of an opportunity to pass up. He put together a caravan including a young half orc named Biter as a caravan guard.  After successfully delivering the weapons, he and his caravan celebrated that evening by drinking Biter’s potent \"experiments\" at the local tavern.  In the pre dawn morning he awoke with a powerful hangover and the previous night a blur. Confused he should have awoken to a hot bath and payment awaiting at the town’s bursar.   Instead he awoke to the ruins of a smoldering tavern. It took all of his presence of mind to grab Biter (his only other surviving caravanner), and take them on his cart out of the village as quick as the mule would go.  Soon the villagers would be looking for the cause of destruction with pitchforks (or worse considering the recent delivery of weapons).  With a worrying glance at his brand as the smoke from the inn fades in the distance he reflects on his change of fortune.  He contemplates a new path, at least until he can figure out what happened that night and how to repair all the things that have gone wrong and the bridges he’s burnt.  Since fleeing the town he has discovered new powers that he has begun practicing with.  Additionally he has been surprised and touched that Biter has stayed with him through this trying time.  What do you do when you when you want to turn over a new leaf in life?  You head home!  Upon reaching Neverwinter the town where he was born, he found work with a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker.  He will join an escort to protect a caravan en route to Philandren.  Some day he will figure out what is this dark power in him is, he will repair relations with the Goldthorns, and he will restore his house from the ruins of Corlinn Hill.  Until then he will survive."}]}

Tristram is a human wizard."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tristram was born in Katagia, the first and only son of Starn and Vinvella Arverus. Like many citizens of the “Last Bastion of Atlantis,” Tristram is of Atlantean blood, and has always lived like one, born with a silver spoon in his mouth. The wealth of a three-generation-long mercantile empire of the Arverus family combined with Vinvella’s youth and wits (being that she is twenty years younger than her aging husband), led Tristram to have a pampered, perhaps even spoiled, upbringing.  As the child of such doting parents, Tristram was provided an education on a small but sizable fortune. Starn and Vinvella wanted nothing but the best for their son and hired only the best tutors to cultivate their son’s growing mind. Tristram excelled in the subjects that interested him: history, medicine, religion, and most importantly, magic. It wasn’t long before Starn and Vinvella realized they would need to find a teacher of more occult leanings.  By chance, while gambling at the Katagian pits, Starn met a surly, but well-spoken man named Graeme, a self-proclaimed “scientist” who conducted necromantic experiments on the unwanted corpses of pit fighters who perished in the arena. Although Graeme was never the mentoring type (unsurprising considering how irritable and antisocial he was most of the time) he was in need of an assistant. Starn’s goodwill and trusting character got the better of him, and at the age of fifteen, Tristram began to study science and magic under Graeme as his apprentice.  Graeme and Tristram’s relationship was rocky at the best of times. While Graeme acknowledged Tristram’s intellect in private, he never professed such thoughts aloud and instead often patronized Tristram to the point of bitter arguments. Despite their differences, Tristram always came back the next day and Graeme continued to tutor him for the next six years. However, as Tristram grew older and began to more adamantly challenge Graeme’s theories, the old wizard pushed back harder and their already unstable relationship fell apart.   For a few years, Tristram studied on his own during the twilight hours, while working for the family business during a more reasonable time of day. Mind you, it wasn’t genuine interest that brought Tristram to the family business, but the prospect of freedom, coin, and power. You see, over the years Tristram had developed a want for importance, lusting for fame and glory, but not from simple merchantry or with Graeme’s name attached. Tristram wanted real power, the power of conquest, the power over life and death, to seek forgotten relics, forbidden knowledge and making coin all along the way.   Tristram had a plan: escort a merchant galley along the coasts of Thule, all the way to Quodeth and make off with the merchandise, the gold, all of it, leave his parents, his teacher, all of Katagia behind him and make a name for himself, a name to be respected, perhaps even feared. Unfortunately, his plan never quite came to fruition, as the merchant galley was sacked by pirates outside Marg and he was left with nothing but the gold on him as he washed up on the shores of Thule.  Marooned, Tristram trekked through the wilderness and found himself, by chance in Quodeth, ragged, hungry, and injured, but demoralized? Oh, no. His tenacity was fueled on pure spite, and desire for vengeance against the pirates that took the gold that was his to steal."}]}

A small village, surrounded by hilly woods on one side and farm lands on the other.  As he came into the world, he was possessed by a newly spawned demon. The demon would randomly take control of his body and commit mischief, causing Viktor’s family a lot of grief. Putting fragile objects close to edges, putting round objects in walkways to cause trips, etc.   At first Viktor, being the innocent child he is, was amused by the mischief. However, as the years progressed the mischief turned more gruesome. Harming small animals, dissecting the barn cats, etc.  When Viktor was 10, the demon caused his 4 year old brother Alexander to drown in the river near the farm. Viktor, not knowing being possessed is not normal, tells his parents he did it. His parents just think he says it out of survivor guilt.  At the age of 12 the demon inside Viktor escalates to murdering a couple of the villagers, and does so undetected. Except Viktor, who witnessed every murder.  On his 13th birthday, the demon decides to kill his family. The demon sneaks up on Viktor’s parents as they sleep and knocks them out with a club. The demon then has Viktor tying up both of them, before overpowering his little sister Anna and tying her up as well. Then, once Viktor’s father is awake, the demon uses Viktor to kill his sister and mother while his father is helpless.   As the demon controlled Viktor finally cuts his father’s throat, a neighbor happened to be dropping by and hears the screaming from outside. The demon takes the backseat again, and watches as Viktor collapses in horror and grief. The neighbor returns with a posse he rallied, and they lock him away. As they discuss what to do with him, a traveling cleric of Mishakal called Lukas hears of the horrible murders, and comes to investigate.   The town elders allow Lukas to examine Viktor, while they watch. The demon responds fiercely to the cleric’s holy powers and, with Viktor being restrained, finally leaves the boy’s body to battle the cleric in its true form. The cleric manages to vanquish the demon after a hard fought battle.  The town elders, having witnessed the battle, set the boy free, but are not willing to take him in. Lukas takes him with him to the main temple of Mishakal, where Viktor is raised by the acolytes of the temple, who also train him over the years to be a cleric, as Viktor has made it his mission in life to prevent what happened to him from happening to anyone else.  At the age of 18, having become an actual cleric with Mishakal’s blessing, he starts traveling the world, at first along with Lukas, and after a couple of years decides to set out on his own.  After multiple decades of travel, in his 59th year, Mishakal’s calling leads him to travel into the mists that lead to Barovia. Unbeknownst to him Mishakal had sent Lukas to Barovia many years before, where he had been driven insane by Strahd. Mishakal sent Viktor to rescue Lukas, and to aid him in what might be a lengthy mission, she slows his aging down to a mere trickle. As always, his goddess leads him to places, but that is the extent of the interaction. He himself has to figure out what needs doing. "}]}

The political landscape of the region is tumultuous at best and open war at worst.  The warlords who call themselves the Barons of the land are in a constant struggle against one another to grab any small amount of power they can.    Rayleigh Oromund spent his formative years witness to countless treacherous pacts.  He was fortunate enough to be born into the relative wealth of a “royal” family in the Kymal Badlands.  His uncle is the greedy and bloodthirsty Baron Morgan.  His mother and father, loyal servants to Morgan, were granted a lavish lifestyle and Rayleigh had a privileged upbringing.  He was trained to fight from an early age and groomed for command of part of Morgan’s army.  Rayleigh takes great pride in his skill as duelist, even if he isn’t keen on fighting fair.  He will go to any length to defeat an enemy, honor is meaningless to him.  After all, in the Kymal Badlands honor and chivalry will leave you on the ground with a knife in your back.    Rayleigh was seemingly set to live in relative ease compared to the majority of residents of Kymal.  Perhaps that’s why he caught the ire of Baron Morgan.  In his paranoia, the Baron saw Rayleigh as a treat to his rule.  He invited Rayleigh on a hunting trip, during which he was set upon by the Baron and his men who tortured him, lashed him to a tree, and left him for dead, telling his family he had died in an hunting accident.   For 4 days and nights he suffered.  Delusional from hunger and dehydration he slipped in and out of consciousness and lost all sense of time.  In what felt like his dying moments, in a last ditch effort for survival, he called out for aid from anyone who was listening. Recalling books he had read about powerful extraplanar entities, he begged for a chance at life, whatever the cost be.  An obscure and ominous entity reached out to him.  It offered him power and a chance at revenge.  It offered a deal: Become a soldier in it’s army, a piece in it’s plan, and in return have a chance at revenge.  Rayleigh accepted.  He awoke the next day invigorated, unbound, and with a mysterious pendant around his neck.  Rayleigh traveled south towards the wall, instructed by his patron to hone his powers before confronting his family.    Rayleigh had 2 impossible tasks ahead of him.  Crossing the wall into Acelia was nigh impossible, and once across he would have to hide his identity, lest he be deported or killed on the spot.   He was fortunate enough to happen upon a group of freelancers, the dwarf Ukrag “Krag” Duli and his party from. Rayleigh begged for help and gave a show of his newly acquired powers.  Ukrag helped Rayleigh recover and inducted into his group where Rayleigh worked for free as repayment doing various odd jobs of questionable morality.  Krag and Rayleigh eventually went their separate ways.  It’s been more than a year since they last spoke and Rayleigh has been wandering around as a sellsword doing various odd jobs. Rayleigh has received no guidance from his patron since he was ordered to hone his skills.  He is hiding his background and offering his services as a mercenary.  He loves the work he does even if he is relatively poor and under-equipped at the moment. "}]}

He's out to find and loot an ancient temple for artifacts. He also occasionally makes references to being a Duke of Waterdeep, and has a great fake signet ring to go with his charlatan backstory. In reality he's got a wife and three daughters who live next to his mentor's mage tower. His recent jail time was for running a ball and cups scam on a town guardsman.  While technically it was an illusion discovered it was really subconsciously self-inflicted so he could get some breathing space away from Connie and the girls. You would think a learned wizard with an unnaturally high IQ and eidetic memory would remember to take the garbage out at night, but Connie always seems to be reminding him to do chores and constantly reminds him of his other failings as a member of a functioning household.   Bobert met his wife while they were running scams together in the city and she's quite a talented rogue herself.   Once the kids arrived, Connie got sensible, Grew Up and Became Responsible.   Bobert is a bit baffled by the change.   Like, he gets the concept of Responsibility and knows why it's good to have.  He has nothing but respect for the responsible people (when he isn't scamming them).  But, when the boots hit the trail it's just not something that he applies to his everyday life.   His usual coping mechanism when faced with things he doesn't want to deal with is to reduce it down to immediate comforts like \"Why is there no good wine on this Demiplane of Evil?\" or \"Instead of talking to these spooky druids why don't we just fireball them and be back at the inn by sunset?\"  He's realized illusions are one of the best ways to avoid thinking/dealing with the truly awful things that happen in the world.    That said, Bobert adores his wife as much as anyone (other than himself) in the world.   Leaving home on a moment's notice to find and loot a temple wasn't really a family decision.  The intensely angry response when he got home was answered with a \"Sorry honey, trapped on a Demiplane of Evil!  No way to get a message back!  Hey look at this amazing staff and chest of gold!\"  Although he does drive Connie crazy she realizes he's still the wild and fun guy she fell in love with.  She just expected him to, you know, GROW UP eventually.   She's still waiting.  Bobert's daughters LOVE their dad.  With his illusions he is the BEST quasi-adult playmate EVER and stuffed monster tea parties with Dad are AWESOME. He's a 'kids should be free to be kids' type in his head but it actually turns out more as an 'I don't set healthy boundaries with children and really most things they break can be fixed with a mending cantrip so why worry' absentee parent. He has a soft spot for kids but after saving them he's blind to any supervisory needs and just kind of assumes they more or less take care of themselves (kind of like cats).             Once he learns the secrets of Ultimate Wisdom and gains Artifacts of Awesome Power his plan is to make the entire family thing actually work for a change and give them all a good life. Unfortunately a few steps in The Plan For Family Success are a bit hazy and his general plan is to simply throw an excessive amount of money and/or magic at things until they're fixed.  It's also more than likely he'll just move on to some other messed up scheme and end up back where they started.      Anyway, after looting that temple and getting rich, maybe he'll get Connie a maid and this whole 'you never take out the trash Bob' thing will blow over."}]}

Her father was a milliner by profession, but Harstvale was not a place that ever seemed in particular need for fancy hats. Her father had never really fit in at Harstvale and he'd always wanted to leave and take his hat-making skills to one of the big cities, but he and her mother, the butcher's daughter, had accidentally conceived Shay when they were fooling around for the first time. When her mother was discovered to be pregnant, her father was forced into a spearpoint wedding that would tie him down to Harstvale forever. Being tied down was particularly difficult because her father never really liked women in that way, but people like him didn't fit in in Harstvale, so he had tried to make things work that one time with her mother, and he was a shocked as she was to find out that she was pregnant.  Oddly she doesn't really bear much of the features of either her father or her mother. The person that bears the most resemblance to her is the town drunk, a half-elf with green eyes and auburn hair that had been an archer in the wars against Tiamat and had come to the town with nightmares and a habit for drinking. Her mother says that the resemblance with this half-elf is pure coincidence.  Her mother named her Beshada, after the goddess of ill fortune. There might be some truth to her name; her mother was watching her one day near the edge of the forest when a group of Goblins came out of the forest and abducted her mother and left her screaming alone for help near the trees. Since then, she has been raised only by her father, who calls her Shay.  She was always mischievous and the town of Harstvale all took an interest in trying to raise her, and it was when she was young that she first took up archery. The town drunk, Delaan, gave her a bow on her 6th birthday, the year after her mother disappeared. He has always claimed that he was too drunk to remember buying it for her, but Shay thought it looked curiously like it had been hand-made in the style of Delaan's own bow. It was almost as if Shay had some elven blood in herself, since she took to archery so naturally. She had soon surpassed the abilities of all the grown men in town except for Delaan who would always stand by and watch her shoot in competitions and the like, and it seemed to be the only time when he wasn't laying about drunk.  Like her father, Shay also loves to make hats, and she creates them in a variety of colors. For herself, she likes to wear a green hat with a red feather in the hat, but she's frequently putting something together in her spare time.  Once she was older, her village was besieged by a band of Goblin that had decided to work together for some ridiculous reason. No one could really fight them, and the whole town was destined to die, until Beshaba challenged their bugbear leader to a fight. He came out ready to crush her, but she pulled out a sling and a stone and hit him right in the eye, and he fell down dead.  Shortly after this, her father sat her down and explained that he couldn't stand to see her get stuck in Harstvale just like he did. It was difficult, but he told her how much he admired her, and that it was her responsibility to get out and be his eyes to see the world. He taught her too that it was her duty to use her talents to help those that cannot help themselves and that change only happens when people stand up and fight for it. So she left, determined to make the world a better place."}]}

Her mother was a known adventuress, the town witch-doctor, and a local hero of no small repute.  All this was fine and normal for a country girl.  The land even enjoyed peaceable co-existence with the nearby goblins of the Ykŏd, but there were so many of them. Then came the day when the hobgoblins and orcs came down from the mountains and whipped the Ykŏd into a frenzy.  The people of Odrith rallied around their heroes, and in mortal combat withstood the onslaught of the horde at tragic cost.  Her mother fell in battle, and despite all help and good intention, her father was ruined afterward.  The vineyard failed and there was not enough food for either of them, until the Winter Carnival came to town.  The master of ceremonies expressed an interest in her singing and dancing talents, so her father let them take her.  But when he later realized he had sold his daughter to the circus for food, he fell into darkness and despair. The child travelled with the Winter Carnival for months and years. Never one for book-learning, she quickly enough caught on to the tricks of the carnies, the acrobatics of the tumblers, and the Sword Dance of the Bessarabian Cossacks. (Though the clowns really creeped her out.)  When she came of age, she made her debut as “Augustanna Fortune” and delighted audiences around the countryside with her dazzling displays.  In due time, the Winter Carnival arrived in the Imperial City of Rochaven, and performed for the Garnok Emperor himself.  Augustanna caught the eye of the Emperor, and he took her in among his court, where she quickly became recognized as a favorite of the Emperor.  This led to all kinds of unwanted attention from obsequious courtiers, and especially drew the ire of the evil Barnaby, the court jester, who was always plotting against the throne.  Now, the Emperor was a good patron to Augustanna, and a noble steward of the Empire.  He was, though, not bold and visionary like his predecessor, nor brash and ruthless like those who would follow him.  He was an old warrior, just keeping the throne warm between ages of Imperial glory.  Barnaby never saw Augustanna as more than the Emperor’s tart of the moment, until she foiled his plots to bring about the Emperor’s downfall.  Though Barnaby’s treachery was not fully revealed, the Emperor saw that it was no longer safe for Augustanna in the Imperial court. He released her from his service, but gave her the protection of his finest Assassin of the Imperial Guard, Colonel Nors Spikes and his henchmen (Rolf and Pauly). She made her own way in the city of Rochaven, avoiding the truly abhorrent, but ultimately falling in with a vile, fat tiefling named Tobin Chort for a manager.  With help from Col. Spikes, she learned the ways of the street, rising above Chort’s machinations to become quite the celebrity in town.  Against better judgement, she was still a frequent guest at the Imperial palace, until the night the Emperor died.  (It should be noted that he passed peacefully, in his sleep, through no obvious fault of hers.)  It all happened so fast … Augustanna was ushered out of the palace that night by Col. Spikes to safety, but Barnaby made sure to raise implications that she was involved in the murder plot when the new emperor started an investigation. She finally had to leave the city.  Col. Spikes had arranged for her passage on board the clipper “Marathon”, captained by Laras Trent.  They learned that Rolf had been killed.  Col. Spikes then ordered Pauly to escort her through the murky back streets of Rochaven to the harbor, but they were beset by the jester’s goons.  She saw Pauly die before they could reach the rendez-vous point.  On her own, Augustanna lurked on the docks while the watchmen of the Imperial Guard confronted Captain Trent.  Yes, he was supposed to carry a girl out of the city, but she had never shown up. They searched the ship and found nothing; only after the guards departed did she sneak aboard and disappear onto the midnight seas. "}]}

Dreaming of becoming a soldier like his father, Markus did his best to learn as much as possible from his father in the short time that he knew him. When he was 9, the elder Drakarhis was slain by an orc during a night time raid on their camp while defending the border from potential threat. Haunted by the death of his father and racked with guilt at his inability to do anything to save him, Markus IV sunk into depression. Despite his age, Markus blamed himself for his father's death, believing that if only he were old enough to join the military then he would have been able to save his father. After years of private training and education, 14-year-old Markus enrolled in the military academy with the aim at being the soldier that he knew he could be, the one that would make his father proud. Shortly after enrollment, it became obvious to those around him that he was gifted. His peers became jealous while Markus developed a sense of superiority over them. While he was not outwardly callous in his treatment of his peers, he developed a sense of arrogance towards them that his teachers picked up on almost immediately. In order to curb this, the head of the academy immediately withdrew Markus from his martial training and placed him in the care of the army clerics of Vartiel - hoping that it would prevent the young Markus from further developing his arrogance, while teaching him the structure that he sorely needed. In the beginning, Markus rebelled against the teachings of Vartiel, viewing them as overly regimented and pointless in his ultimate goal in becoming a soldier. It was not until he met Kildrak Ungar, a battle-priest of Valtiel, did he become aware of just how connected the teachings of his God and the tenets of the military were. With renewed vigor, Markus set out become not only the best soldier in the military, but a battle-priest beyond compare.  Upon graduation, which coincided with his 21st birthday, Markus had made a name for himself that would have undoubtedly made his father happy. The arrogance banished and his training over, Markus was assigned to a small border town that had come under attack several times by bands of orcs and the occasional group of bandits. All of his dreams were finally coming true and he relished the opportunity to further make a name for himself and rise in the ranks of the military. Unbeknownst to Markus, however, his time in the military would be a short one.  The first night after his arrival, the town came under attack by a large band of orcs. They burned, killed, and pillaged anything in sight and the small regiment was no match for them. Knowing this must be what his father had seen before drawing his last breath, Markus was paralyzed with fear and guilt, unable to assist in the defense despite having every desire to do so. The town was almost completely destroyed and most of his regiment, his friends and new family, were murdered. The few survivors blamed Markus and his inaction for the slaughter and he was immediately discharged with great shame.  Unable to face his family back home, Markus wandered the wilds on his own, trying to seek solace in whatever he could find. He blamed himself, he blamed the orcs, but mostly he blamed Vartiel for seemingly abandoning him. Turning his back on his faith, Markus attempted several times to take his own life as the depression of his youth resurfaced. Unsuccessful, he continued to wander from town-to-town doing odd jobs when he could and sleeping in stables when he could not.  This continued for some years until a fateful encounter with a priest of Stagg. Who, after some time in his company, managed to convince Markus that his past was nothing to be ashamed of and that all was not lost. At 27, he converted to the worship of Stagg, believing that the warrior God enabled him to use his skills as a battle-priest while avoiding the rigid tenets of Vartiel. Deciding that while his military life was a failure, his life did not need to be and his name did not have to remain sullied. And so, with renewed vigor, he would reinvent himself as a mercenary and guardian for the poor, downtrodden and helpless. Protecting them from the evils that would do them harm... with a hammer and a prayer."}]}

He secures Andom a position as a clerk for the regional governor.  Growing up, the family was not particularly religious, but Andom’s father would sometimes bring the family to attend services at the temple of Amaunator.   His mother’s name is Pret.  He is an only child.  When he was growing up, he would often go climbing on the rocky cliffs surrounding the town.  At the governorate in Cupriston, as an official clerk, Andom had privileged access to all the texts in the state library.  One day, while perusing the titles, he happened to come across a text called “The Ashes of the Gods”, by La Rang Chen. It’s an encyclopedia of all the gods thought to have died.  As he flips through the book, he comes across an entry for Auppenser.  When he reads the name, it’s like an icicle is driven into his brain, as he is exposed, for just a second, to the divine essence of Auppenser.   When he comes to, he’s captivated.  He reads the entry on Auppenser in the book, then he pours through the library for all the texts which might mention the god,  He pieces together that Auppenser still lives, but in a deep sleep, and that his followers are all gone.  In reading about his values and precepts, Andom feels a sense of real connection.  Over the next few year, he pores over the few texts in the library that give even a passing mention to Auppenser, and tries to learn everything he can from them.  He teaches himself to meditate.  As well, he focuses on trying to develop a more stoic outlook on life.  During this period, one of his biggest supports was his friend Birmo Stubb, a halfling and a fellow clerk.  Initially, when Andom told Birmo about his new interest in Auppenser, he was not taken seriously.  But after some time, Birmo finally understood that Andom was a sincere believer.  Shortly before Andom’s departure, Birmo converted to the Church of Auppenser in a private ceremony in his apartment.    Departure:  It was in the back of his head for a while, but when he converts Birmo, he becomes acutely aware of how little he still knows about Auppenser or His former church.  He realizes that he cannot solidly reestablish the church if he remains ignorant about the fundamentals of his faith.  He resolves to go wandering in order to learn, both to find texts and other sources of knowledge that might not have made it to his library, and to try to find spiritual enlightment and wisdom, which could point the way to Auppenser, in his travels.  Andom bought some travelling equipment, resigned his commission, said his farewells, and left.  Birmo stayed behind to continue work as a clerk.  When Andom had brought up the issue of Auppenser, and especially when he resigned his commission, his father Jurgo Perronick strongly disapproved,  seeing the Slumbering God as being even less worth the trouble of working with than a regular, living god.  As a going away present, Birmo gave him a poncho he had made; this poncho is now one of Andom’s most prized possessions.      Andom carries a journal with him as he tries to reassemble the shattered faith.  In it, he writes down all the information on Auppenser that he is able to find in his researches, as well as the sensations and thoughts he experienced during profound moments and contacts with the divine, his personal musings, and any other information or bits of wisdom which might help to guide a future Church of Auppenser.  The book is thus both a personal journal and a holy text.  After leaving Cupriston, Andom wandered the land looking for libraries and ruins that might contain shreds of information about his adopted faith.  As he traveled, he would pick up odd jobs here and there.  He had some skill with cooking (simple stews mainly) and so was able to find some work as a chef for merchant caravans.  Although he strives towards the stoic ideal of a servant of Auppenser, he often falls short in rage and frustration.  Although he would be unwilling to admit it, much of his motivation for seeking to achieve great deeds is selfish; he wants the respect that comes from heroics and mighty accomplishments.  Preoccupied with proving himself, especially to himself.  Because of this, he will often choose the bolder, flashier, more ambitious choice out of an array of options, even when that may not be well advised. He is scared of deep water.   He is close friends with his first convert, Birmo Stubb, a clerk in Cupriston.  His father Jurgo Perronick tried to steer him into the bureaucracy, and strongly discouraged his new faith.  Andom’s attitude towards his father contains elements of resentment and pride, despite genuinely loving him. "}]}

For one, it was a blessing, after years of being childless, the Chief finally had an offspring. On the other hand, that offspring turned out to be a girl; tradition dictates that the firstborn is supposed to succeed the Chief, however, the law forbids women from becoming Chieftains. Two years later, Liulfr was born and anointed as the successor to the throne of Rek. It’s not that women are regarded as inferior or that they need protection, the gods know that Rek women need no one to protect them, but their roles are far more important than government or war, they are tasked with the spiritual and social wellbeing of the society. As such, from a small age young Sigrid was taught the traditions, laws and history of her people, molding her to one day succeed the eldest. And for a time, she was happy, that is until she was 12, the age when all Rek citizens, men and women alike, are required to learn basic defense and weapons training. The axes became an extension of herself, battle training was the highlight of her days and soon, one day becoming the elder, was no longer as important as the excitement of combat. Training after “boot camp” was an uphill battle for Sigrid, her mother and father were not eager to allow her “hobby” to continue, yet she pressed on and became one of the fiercest warriors of her age. She trained and trained in her ever shrinking free time. Yet no matter how much she trained, her fate was sealed, real combat or chief hood were out of her reach, she was almost ready to give up and accept her face and then, Liulfr turned 12 and began his combat training, what she saw horrified her. Liulfr’s combat style was not honorable, he bragged about his dirty triumphs and humiliated his opponents, this, was not the way a future chief was supposed to behave. Attempts were made to modify this behavior, but sometimes it is futile to fight against someone’s nature. 5 years passed, Sigrid was now 19 and Liulfr 17. The two of them and a small contingent were sent to a frontier village facing raids from an expanding neighbor. Having talked to envoys declaring their intentions to annex Rek territory, Sigrid concluded that staying and fight was the obvious course of action, however, Liulfr had ideas of his own. He arranged a secret meeting with the envoys and gave up the town in exchange for some gold and exotic items from foreign lands. Hours later, Sigrid, Liulfr, the warriors and the villagers who agreed to leave town without a fight were en route back to the capital. Sigrid watched as those brave villagers who stayed behind to defend their property were being slaughtered and their town razzed to the ground. This was the last straw, by Tempus, she would no longer stand by and allow her cowardly brother to shame her family name. When they were back and Liulfr explained how the raiders’ numbers were superior and the town served no strategic or economic value, Sigrid lost it, she charged at her brother. He was bigger and stronger, but Sigrid smarter and more determined, they battled for minutes that seemed like hours, at the end Sigrid stood above a defeated Liulfr. Her time studying and learning the laws of traditions of Rek were finally put to good use, citing old law concerning the wives of death Chiefs, Sigrid issued a challenge to his brother, she would leave, and return only in glorious triumph, which meant having earned the admiration and respect of both enemies and friends upon which a final duel between her and her brother would decide who would finally become Chief. Storming out of the great hall before anyone could stop or talk to her, she walked away with only what was already on her, her trusty axes, her battle armor and the few rations left from her trip to the frontier. 3 weeks into her pilgrimage, she met a group of villagers who were trying to hunt down a slave party who had raided their village and took their possessions and women. Sigrid was able to track them down and simply walked into their camp with the villagers behind her, demanded the release the prisoners, and when the slavers refused, Asvald and Athils (her two small axes) flew across the air and found their targets in the chest of two slavers, using the ensuing confusion to charge against the biggest man, who was possibly the leader. In a swift move, she took her battle axe and slayed the man. The villagers were successful in killing or apprehending the rest of the slavers, soon, the slavers were inside the cages and the women free. Upon returning to the village, a small elf girl who didn’t seem to belong there, caught Sigrid’s attention. The frail elf didn’t seem to have a home and was eager to follow Sigrid on her journey, for her part, Sigrid was happy to have someone to talk to, also believing that if she ever wants to be Chief, she must take care of the defenseless first."}]}

Tanna is a human barbarian."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first time she tried to summon her totem animal, she nearly froze to death before returning to the barbarian encampment empty-handed.  Five days she spent out in the wilderness, slowly growing more hungry and more numb as the certainty that this was her path faded into nothingness and she was left with only herself, small and empty and alone.  She'd tried so hard to learn their ways, despite not being one of them, honing herself to be stronger and work harder and be as harsh and severe as the north winds.  But no spirit animal came, and only then did she let the truth sink into her heart like a cold heavy stone.  She was unworthy.  Too civilized, too ignorant, an outsider.  Maybe it was cowardly to leave.  She'd learned much from the tribe, made friends, learned their ways to the best of her ability, learned how to live off even the most uninhabitable tundra lands, and somewhere deep down she was grateful for that, but the rawness of her heart made it impossible for her to stay.  So she wandered in the only direction she knew, finally arriving home to her modest childhood home.  Her father had always been a wild soul, so different from her quarter-dwarf mother, who was calm and solid and steady as the earth.  He was gone often, always wandering the wilds and bringing home strange artifacts and stranger creatures, spouting cliche little proverbs about protecting nature and the magic of the earth.  He always grew restless before even a fortnight passed, promised to be back soon, and left again.  If Tanna's mother ever minded his long absences, she never showed it, content with taking good care of her home.  He barely made it home the day he died, weak and ashen with a death rattle already in his throat.  He told Tanna and her mother he loved them, and as his weathered hand weakly grasped Tanna's, he whispered, the last hoarse words of an old man, \"Be good.  Be good.\"  She stayed with her mother for a little while, but before long her soul ached with wanderlust once more.  \"You have much of your father in you,\" her mother finally said, \"and you're wearing holes in my carpet,\" and all but pushed her out the front door.  Finding her cousin Adric was both harder and more joyful than she'd anticipated.  Deep in some caves finding treasure and fighting elementals, he was nearly impossible to track down, but seeing his face again after a year and a half was like seeing the sun for the first time.  When was the last time she'd laughed, or even truly smiled without the weight of the world on her shoulders?  He didn't comment on her appearance, but she caught his sidelong looks, and she knew him well enough to recognize his concern.  They'd practically grown up together, only one town apart, and everything Adric had learned about fighting he'd taught her as well.  They both shared the same hint of dwarf blood from their mothers, naturally strong and wide and both possessing the same love of the thrill of battle.  And the same love of good strong drink, and good food, and beautiful women.  They sat around a fire that night, drinking all of Adric's ale and telling each other all the stories they'd missed over the past eighteen months, embellishing and exaggerating until they were in stitches from laughter.  It hit her like a wave, deeper than oceans, the way she loved him, the way she loved this, aching with travel and laughter, drunk and overwhelmed with joy, once again filled with the surety that the world was a vast and unimaginably beautiful place.  They traveled together for a while, drinking and laughing and camping their way through every imaginable climate, making friends wherever they could and fighting all manner of beasts and fiends, picking up companions here and there and staying up nights staring at the stars and telling stories and laughing themselves sick.  They stayed in taverns when it was clean and convenient, but Tanna loved sleeping on a bedroll on the dirt under a canopy of trees and clouds and wild night sky more than any bed.  As much as she loved the camaraderie of a party of like-minded adventurers, even more entrancing was every new village they found, every new and wild and far-flung tribe that she could convince or bribe to teach her about the land, what plants were good to eat and how to find water and what to avoid and how to survive.  She made every climate and every biome her friend, coaxing out its secrets with bright-eyed adoration, and those nights when she fell asleep with charred meat and sweet mead in her stomach with stars whirling overhead, she thought she could happily live like that forever.  But there was something that still whispered to her, in her heart of hearts, something deep in the earth that was ancient and powerful and benevolent and was ever calling her by name.  She began dreaming of the sun, of warm wind and fast clouds and the soft susurrus of tall grass.  And a voice, deep and mellow and honey-gold, speaking words she couldn't yet understand.  So she and Adric parted ways, he compelled home for the love of his family, and she unable to shake the thought of south, south from her mind."}]}

They are stereoypically thought of as vagrants and theives.  But, they have a full robust culture of mystics, entertainers, traders, artisans, and philosophers.  They have dark hair usually grown long.  Patrin make fine wigs which command a fair price but take quite some time to make due to the nature of the materials.  Skin tones range from pale olive and tan all the way to deep chestnut brown with close relatives typically sharing similar complexions.  Eye colors other than brown or black are extremely rare.  Body types also range from short and slight to tall and broad, with little variation between men and women.  There are occasional pockets of half evles among the Patrin. Evgeni is not one of that sort of Patrin.  He is a thief, a burgler to be exact.  Bands of Patrin will sometimes sneak into communities at night to rob from unattended businesses or carry away other valuables.  These items will then be sold at the next town for a much better price than would be availble from a local fence. Abraxas the Unfathomable is one of the dreaded Demon Kings that Conn defeated and sealed away before the founding of the Empire.  Evgeni accidentally freed Abraxas while robbing the Temple of Bufkabufta, a monlithic monument built nearly 600 years ago.  This is considered an equally heinous crime in the Citystate of Nexus, the Connen Empire, and among the Council of Free Kingdoms. Bufkabufta was a king allied to the Empire who ruled the area during the Decline.  He is considered one of the honored Host of Kings in the Connen theocracy but is also celebrated locally for his benevolence and wisdom.  Bufkabufta is known in legend across most of the civilized world as a proxy for especially kind, benevolent rulership.   Abraxas gifted him the power to use magic and commanded him to sow chaos and destruction.  Evgeni has not seen or been contacted by Abraxas since that time.  He is unsure if the command was meant to be taken literally or if Abraxas has any interest in checking in on him.  That is for the best as Evgeni is wanted in most civilized nations and traveling has been difficult. \"Ok, so...  We were in the Temple of Bufkabufta and we were robbing the place. Granted we, we were but it didn't start like that.  We were told that the temple was built on top of a ruin from even earlier than Bufkabufta that we could get into an find something to make a little money.  The ruins were there but it took forever to get to them because of all the people trying to keep us out of the temple.  Once we got in there were a ton of traps, bad ones.  We were almost ready to cut our losses and get out of there and we found the tomb thing.  It was a big stone door probably 20 feet high and just as wide. And there was this poem, and it said something, but it was a riddle.  And the answer to the riddle was that you had to light something on fire, we didn't really know the language, I mean we did, but in retrospect, no.  No, I guess we didn't.  But, we figured out that you had to light something on fire to \"unlock\" something.  And we had to light a couple of things on fire, but we put em out when they didn't work.   Until the last one, the last fire did something because the whole door of the \"tomb\" thing shifted and moved and rolled over to the side and this thing comes out.  And it's got like the body and arms of a man but snakes for legs, and it has a rooster's head and a golden sheild but it's not holding the shield it's just like wearing it up on it's shoulder.  It's got a scourge in one hand and in the other, the arm with the sheild, it's got the reins of these four huge white warhorses.  And they're hooked up to this gold chariot, but the thing isn't in the chariot it's just floating in the air above the chariot.  And this thing is probably 14' tall and the horses are huge and there's four of them and a gold chariot so all of this comes rushing up out of this tomb thing and it knocks over the oil lamp we were using to light things on fire.   And there was no wick in the lamp.  We took it out to get a bigger flame to light stuff on fire.  In retrospect, that was a mistake.   But anyway I honestly didn't see it get knocked over because the whole time this thing is talking and not like with its mouth... beak.  It's talking inside my head, and the guys I was with too I guess, but they're dead.  Probably.  And its all talking about how it's \"Abraxas the Unfathomable\"  and we freed it and it's going to give us power and then it screams at us to \"Go forth into the world and bring CHAOS AND RUIN!\"   And then it flew away.  Like the horses ran but they ran up the air and the whole thing just flew off.  And that's when we noticed the fire which by this time is admittedly, pretty huge.  I got separated from Hristo and Petya while we were escaping and haven't seen them since then.  And now I can cast spells.\" "}]}

He is a human druid."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "One day a halfling woman named Cora Springbreeze was out gathering herbs near the forest by her village. The baby was covered in moss in a shallow pit at the base of a large tree. She reached for the child, who was giggling and smiling, despite his circumstances. She took the baby home and her and her husband Wellby cleaned all the moss off of him. However, no matter how often they cleaned the moss, the moss on his shoulders always grew back, and would even cover that spot oh his clothing. They looked for his parents, but never managed to find them, and eventually took him in as their own. They named him Alexander Springbreeze, and from that day on he was loved and would want for nothing.   Growing up in the Harmonias Knolls was always interesting, the town trived off of being a middle ground for people to meet up and do bussiness. People came from far and wide to meet and do bussiness here, because of how nice the people were, and more importantly, the wonderful food. It wasn't uncommon that older folk would come and vacation, and once and awhile someone would end up staying. When Alexander was a young child the village was entirely Halfling, but by the time he was a teen a few humans, an elf woman, her human husband and thier 2 half elf daughters Tera and April (who Alexander had a crush on), and a grumpy old dwarf had built homes in the village. Alexander was always a bit of an odd child, everyone was a little taken back by the moss that grew on his shoulders and his talking to plants and many off the villagers took to calling him Moss Ball, but his sunny disposition always made them friends in the end.  For as long as Alexander could remember he had been talking to plants. They would tell him stories, and he was always at ease in their pressence. The plants always called him Pothos, he never knew why, but also never felt the need to question it. He was actually quite fond of the name, as the name Alexander just never sounded right to him. He loved plants of all varieties and when he was of age to start working would spend his days gathering wild herbs, fruits, and mushrooms. The villagers loved him for it because nobody has ever gathered as much as him, it was as if the plants were finding him they thought. Alexander was truely happy, so much so that nobody could remember him being anything else. One day when Alexander was out strolling through the meddow he ran into a beautiful large blue flower. He spent the entire day talking to that flower and when darkness came and Alexander was about to say his goodbyes, the flower thanked him for his time and asked him to please come by in the morning, and that there would be something waiting for him. The next day Alexander went back into the forest to find the flower, but it was gone. In it's place was a small bundle of leaves, which upon inspection, contained 4 seeds. Alexander asked the surrounding grass what happened, but grass thinks of little besides \"bask and eat\" so he took bundled the leaves back up and took the seeds back home with him.   Just before ariving at his village, he saw a dense black smoke on the horrizon. He ran and found a group of bandits surrounded all of the villagers, pillaging the houses and harrasing the half elf April. For the first time in his life, Alexander became angery, and he leaped on the first bandit he saw and bashed him over the head with his staff. Seeing this 2 of the other bandits grabbed their swords and before they could do get close enough to attack massive thorny vines grew out from the moss on Alexanders' shoulders, wrapped around his arms and lashed out ripping the the throat of one, and choking the life out of the other. Then an arrow went wizzing by alexander, he turned to see another bandit with a bow reloaded and aimed right at him. As he released his arrow Alexander took the bandit he was choking and moved him so that the arrow struck him. He released the now dead bandit and with his other, now vineless hand, reached out towards the bandit and shot out a liquid directly into his face. The bandit screamed with pain as he fell to the ground, the skin on his face bubbeling and melting away. \"someone help!\" he heard, coming from the burning home of the grumpy old dwarf, Rold Frostbeard. Alexander rushed into the burning home and came back out moments later, with the dwarf in his arms. The moss on his right shoulder on fire he quickly smothered the flame. He then heard a scream, as he looked up he saw April, with a bandit's knife to her throat. Alexander disapeared, and repeared as a massive wolf behind the bandit, tearing at the bandit's throat.  With the last bandit dispatched, and all of the villagers saved, Alexander turned back into his normal self, covered in the blood of the bandits and burns covering his right arm. He fell to his knees and cried for the first time in his life. Not entirely sure what he did, or how he did it, all he could think about was all the pain he inflicted. His mother stood up from the crowd and went over to him, as she neared and he looked up at her she stepped back, for just a moment, afraid. Seeing this Alexander returned to his wolf form, and ran away, dropping one of his 4 seeds behind him. "}]}

Cerise is a human fighter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cerise Firevale was born on the first day of summer alongside her twin sister, Ferra. While the two shared nearly identical faces, they were almost the complete antithesis of one another.  Cerise was gifted with the vibrant red hair of her father's, while Ferra inherited her mother's jet-black locks. Cerise grew to be curious, generous and unerringly kind, whereas Ferra became colder and more distant the more she aged. The more the girls grew it became clearer and clearer that they were fated to be polar opposites of one another. It was odd, to say the least, but Cerise never seemed to mind. Being the kindhearted girl that she was, she always tried to get along with her sister when they were younger. That all changed the moment it came time for their schooling at age 7.  The Firevale family is a house of nobility that is well-known among the townspeople of Ashbourne. They have a stunning reputation as a family of spellcasters, every single member of the core bloodline becoming a successful sorcerer or sorceress... That is, until Cerise. The polarity that existed between the twins appeared to extend even to their talents, and saw Ferra being gifted with immense magical acuity just begging to be fostered and developed into terrifying thaumaturgical prowess. Cerise, on the other hand, possessed no magical talent whatsoever. Try as she might, she couldn't even conjure a simple Prestidigitation spell. She tried and tried, desperately wanting not to disappoint her parents, but to no avail. She just didn't have what it took to become a sorceress and continue the family tradition. When she begged her sister for help, Ferra simply dismissed her, saying she had always known this would happen, that she would be the one to further the family's tradition. According to her, Cerise hadn't the temperament or the mental fortitude for the magical arts. Ferra then left her there, that conversation marking the beginning of Cerise's new life.  Her parents pretended not to mind. They enrolled her in martial training instead, to see if she would be better suited with a sword or an axe in her hand rather than a book or a staff. When she immediately began to excel, Cerise could tell that her parents truly gave up on her. They tried to disguise their disappointment, but Cerise could tell. The longer it went on the more it felt like the love they expressed toward her was just a lie, an obligation. A formality. But it didn't last long. As time went on Cerise's parents grew colder toward her, similar to the way Ferra had. Cerise suspected that she embarrassed them. That they were tired of the residents of Ashbourne asking about her, querying why she wasn't being raised as a sorceress like Ferra was. Cerise began to feel that it was her fault, that something was wrong with her. She felt like a guest in her own home. A guest that was overstaying her welcome.    Cerise began to wander outside of her family's estate. She felt claustrophobic within its walls, as if she would be suffocated if she stayed there too long. It was refreshing to talk to the townspeople. They never judged her the way her family did. The streets of Ashbourne soon became Cerise's new home where she would stay whenever she wasn't otherwise kept within the Firevale estate. Her family never cared enough to ask where she was during the day, instead showering Ferra with attention.  At the age of 10 Cerise met a man from a party of adventurers that often came to Ashbourne to spend a few nights at the inn and resupply. The man's name was Bardren, a roguish type with a dazzling smile and a kind heart. He gave silver pieces to the children around town, who would always go and spend them on candy. Cerise would always be seen trailing behind him whenever he was around. He told her the most fascinating stories about the outside world. She'd never left the town of Ashbourne, left completely ignorant of life elsewhere. Bardren told her tales of towering castles, crumbling caves, terrifying dungeons, and people of all kinds. The only experience Cerise had with other races was the innkeeper – she was an elf. Aside from that, at least as far as she knew, all of Ashbourne was human. Bardren spoke of dwarves, drow elves, halflings, gnomes, even the living dead. The more stories he told her the more she desperately wanted to see it for herself. Eventually Cerise told Bardren of the way her family had been treating her. Though clearly upset by it, he promised her that he wouldn't make any trouble over it. He didn't want to make things worse for her. Instead he continued to do what he always did, telling her stories whenever she asked and allowing her to follow him around. He soon became the caring family Cerise so painfully craved. As long as Bardren continued to visit Ashbourne, Cerise had something to look forward to.  Years passed. Cerise began to find that as she matured, the more she thought of Bardren differently. Dreams of him taking her to see the world were sometimes replaced by the two of them having a wedding together. These bittersweet dreams often ended with Cerise waking in the middle of the night, crying. She didn't want to think of him that way. Those feelings would only serve to remind her that he wasn't her real family, that her real family had all but abandoned her when she was just a child.  On her 20th birthday Cerise went out to find Bardren, who had promised to meet her. She couldn't find him. She did, however, find his party, looking much worse for wear, as though they had been through hell and back. Fearing the worst, she asked them what had happened. Bardren was dead. Cerise stood there for the better part of an hour. When she looked down at her hand she was holding a bright gold amulet. One of the party members had placed it in her hand, saying Bardren had wanted her to have it. With that they left her there, in shock and very much alone.  Cerise decided to leave that night. She wouldn't stay in the house that had shunned her for another moment. Waiting until the dead of night, she gathered the things most important to her and crept outside. She made her way into the guardhouse within her family's estate and took a set of armor, as well as a sword and shield. It was the only time she had ever stolen anything and she felt terrible, but Bardren had taught her that the world is wrought with danger.  Cerise had a goal, and that was to earn her family's respect. She refused to be ashamed of her surname, instead embracing it and hoping to one day return as a successful and proud warrior. Until then, she would travel the lands and help as many people as she could."}]}

Randal is a human fighter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Randal’s mother, Anet Cor Marak, came from a well-respected merchant family living in the city of Ankhapur on the Lake of Steam. The “bloodline of fire” (hereditary traits passed down from the efreeti rulers of nearby Calimshan’s past) burned strongly in her family, and showed clearly in Anet. Her hair flickered with all the motion and color of flames, and the ever-present scent of smoke followed wherever she went. When Anet came of age she traveled to Waterdeep to pursue her own ambitions, eager to establish herself as a successful businesswoman. While not the largest or most successful in Waterdeep, her trading company has established itself as a notable authority in coastal trading.  Anet met Randal’s father while living in Waterdeep. A mediocre wizard and member of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, Grim Wolfswit assisted Anet when her distinctive appearance drew hostility from groups who mistook her for a sorcerer. Each sparking curiosity in the other, the two courted and after several years married. Anet & Grim had two sons, Gewar and his younger brother Randal. The bloodline of fire continued, though faintly, in the brothers. Gewar never looked kindly upon his brother, and from his very birth he had seen Randal as a thief. His parent’s time and love kept being squandered on the little brat, when really he deserved it more. Growing up, Gewar never held back in fights with Randal. Randal in turn learned very quickly how to protect himself, how to take a hit, and how to give back as good as he got. Randal spent his whole childhood fighting someone bigger and stronger who genuinely hated him, and grew up to be someone who never backed down even against overwhelming odds.  In Randal’s teen years, he grew stronger than his brother who chose not to fight him physically after having lost for the first time. Gewar’s resentment only multiplied, while Randal became restless. The frequent fistfights had been a much needed routine for him, and without his usual opponent he sought out an alternative. He discovered vigilante groups like the Red Sashes, and took to the streets at night where he put his fists to good use. He learned cruel things operated in the city’s darkest corners, heard names like the Xanathar’s Guild. Gewar had long seen mastering his father’s trade, learning to work magic, would finally prove him the better and smarter son. As they grew older, Gewar’s insistence intensified to a level of harassment that burned into argument when Grim snapped at his demanding son. After the worst of those fights, Gewar despaired thinking his father would never share his arts. His despair turned to rage, his addled mind saw this as just one more thing stolen from him by Randal. He would solve this, and prove his worth all at once. Gewar stole magical implements from his father’s study and prepared a lethal trap. He planned to murder his brother using the very magic his father deemed him unworthy to learn. And he would watch it happen.  Gewar set his trap and waited. He knew Randal came home late most nights, and he had prepared perfectly. Grim, laying awake that night, thought to get up and go speak to Gewar. He knew the boy showed promise, but had trouble getting him to proceed at the proper pace. Grim came out to see Randal stepping in, he saw Gewar waiting in the shadows, and his senses soon noted the mystical energies suffusing the room. In a moment of unthinking panic, Grim threw himself forward and knocked Randal out of the way of the trap. Randal looked up to see his father slain in agony as conjured spears of ice skewered him from all directions. Gewar went mad. He lept from hiding to beat his brother with his fists, shouting how Randal had taken his father from him. Randal took the first few hits, still too shocked to believe what he had seen. When he did piece it together, he knocked his brother off him with a single punch. Gewar unconscious on the floor, Randal went to his father’s side. Already he knew nothing could be done. A noise came from the stairs. He looked up to see his mother frozen in place, her features lost in silent horror. Randal couldn’t think, he felt guilt, imagined Anet blaming him for everything. He couldn’t face her, but he couldn’t leave her alone with his murderous brother. He took Gewar and left. Carrying the unconscious Gewar through side alleys and rarely used streets, he left for somewhere unhealthy. Randal met with the Agents of the Eye, what those in the Xanathar’s Guild called themselves. Slavers, blackmailers, thieves, and worse. He dropped his brother at his feet. He’d heard the stories, he knew you couldn’t join the guild without a blood offering. Though Xanathar’s offerings required a family member, dead or given to the slavers. He joined that day, and never went home.  Years in service to the Xanathar’s Guild wore on Randal’s mind. He’d tried not to think too much about his work, preferring to just act in service to the guild and collect his pay. He turned to Cyric’s teachings, hoping religion could help him accept his chosen path. Yet as time passed, he started to think himself a fool. He’d blamed himself for his father’s death, no one had done that to him. And he’d never even asked what it was his brother had attempted or why. He hadn’t cared, just cleaned it up. He didn’t even know any more whether or not his brother still lived. Randal reached a conclusion one day: he’d done nothing wrong the night his father died. Not until he’d joined the Xanathar’s Guild. And he’d spent years serving them, inflicting pain and death for his masters. Now he had done something worthy of the shame and guilt he’d felt that night.  Randal considered that maybe it was too late, and what he’d done couldn’t be redeemed. But he knew trying had to feel better than continuing on this way. He left the Xanathar’s Guild as quietly as he could, hoping to leave little of a trail for them to follow. Similarly, he looked for a way out of Cyric’s church… but feared some divine retribution for his abandonment. His thoughts turned to the gods Cyric hated most: Mystra & Kelemvor.  Kelemvor’s church taught the importance of honoring the dead, remembering what they had contributed in life and serving their families in trying times. Randal couldn’t speak to how many lives he had ended prematurely. He could be sure it hadn’t been countless, just that his mind struggled to forget what he had done. One day he might die and find himself in Kelemvor’s presence, judged as one of the False for betraying his vows to Cyric’s church. Maybe that inevitable sentence could be lessened by doing penance in service to Kelemvor’s faith. Maybe if he joined a group of adventurers he could find enough opportunities to redeem his past actions. If nothing else, perhaps he could do enough good he could face his mother without feeling so ashamed."}]}

Andi is a human wizard."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Andi was born in a small town a stone’s throw from Telis. Her parents met abroad; since they were from the same area and visited the same markets in Telis, he from within the city and they were from the same area and visited the same markets in Telis, he from within the city and she from a village half a day’s journey out, they had a lot to talk about. It was an odd pair. Mother was a second-generation immigrant, raised practical and worldly, while father was a child of a family long known for its doctors of magic and administrators of wizard matters. He was getting older and restless, and she was intrigued with his restlessness despite his privilege.  Their choice of place to settle down was tactical, not too close to his origin, not too far from hers, but adjoining Telis for its opportunity. She wasn’t anxious to start a family, and it was longer than he or his kin liked before Andi was born. When Andi was eight, she gained a brother and her mother left. It wasn’t entirely clear that the boy’s father was the same as hers. She hadn’t seen her mother since. Andi half-raised her much younger brother, adding an extra burden to the intense pressure to be a high achiever.  Her father moved back to the family estate in the city and took the kids with him. He was out most of the time. Her brother was a bad combination of defiant and a little dumb. Her father grew sad and cool, and their relationship was turbulent. After an eternity, Andi made it out of first school and her father gladly paid her way to the top-tier boarding school of her choice, at the foot of the mountains outside of Scandrow. Her brother began military training soon after, in his early teens, and she would only see him once in all her time at school. The boarding school was full of rich girls and overqualified teachers who were delighted with any student who really wanted badly to learn. She was such a student. She ate up history, arcana, languages, and wealth studies. She was clearly fast-tracked for advanced wizardry.  Always a straight-edge by necessity, she did not indulge much in her freedom away from home, finding more comfort in books than in friends. Her achievement made her unpopular; her skin, one shade darker than the crowd, subtly alienated her. Her strong opinions about the ways the other girls ought to be using their expensive time at school, and her liberty with snapping at them, didn’t help. Extra time was occupied by two newfound passions: botany and martial magic. Her introductory plants and lifeforms class introduced her to the astonishing variety in land flora. The teacher conspired with the groundskeeper to grant her a tiny plot to garden, eager to see a student pass in her studies from the labeled drawings in the required reading into the real world. Andi was not excellent at gardening, but she found unusually pure joy in her trivial successes at making life. As in many high-end boarding schools, there were exotic options for fitness credit; one on offer was combat spellcasting. The quiet, focused instructor became her first real friend at school. Andi would stay after class, half practicing, half confiding. With shared trust, the pair were able to go further than gym credit, taking on riskier combat techniques: fire, and blinding light. When Andi could finally relax with her magic, she found that she could move small objects or cause people to hear or feel brief illusions without much effort. After that, she had no end of fun sharing subtle magical jokes with her mentor and friend in class at the other girls’ expense. There was a cultural enrichment exchange program with the native dwarfish folk of the mountain. Unsophisticated but wise people, they often conferred with local earth elementals about weather or war. Andi studied up on Terran and excitedly enrolled. She would meet briefly with her large and profoundly foreign exchange student, and then she would trek with a donkey, a guide, and a few interested others up the valley. The natives were gruff but generous with their time, laughing at her Terran pronunciation mistakes and sending her on errands to find novel forest foodstuffs. In the evenings, she would be reluctant to leave. Never once did she see an elemental. Still, the folks’ grounded lifestyle rubbed off on her, feeding a lust for the outdoors and unknown places. Matters of the heart were never tidy for Andi. As an upperclassman, she cautiously tried at romance with the other girls a few times. Andi could never fully connect, and so she broke some hearts before she decided that now was not the time for her. In lulls she would often imagine where her mother had gone, and what kind of person she had become. Her memories of life before she left had become scattered and vague. It was an unconscious certainty to her that someday, she would have to find her and put her story together. The one time she saw her brother when her leave overlapped with his, she found that he was doing frustratingly well. Apparently, his intellect was better suited to tactic than primary math; he had risen to Corporal, re-stationed at a northern city at the border. Andi felt acutely that her life was on pause. Andi graduated half a year early. She rented for a time in metropolitan Scandrow, immediately catching a job as a low-level library administrator. Upper-echelon urban wizarding establishments knew the Arewas name. She did not tell her father she had exited school, and she had no intention to return to his sad and empty home, though she felt awful for scorning him so. Untied from all commitments at last, she experimented tentatively with pubs and intoxicants in her restlessness. Still, guilt over her lapse in discipline nagged her every day. Once, word got around that a bandit camp in the hills had been deserted all at once, leaving valuable goods behind; no one knew why. Seeing adventuring parties emerging, all intent on getting the first pick of the treasure, she decided that enough was enough waiting for her life to begin. She hastily purchased quite a lot of adventuring goods and some very nice leather armor, using up most of the money she had on her. She was able to convince some very loud young men that they could use a wizard on their way to the empty encampment. That party’s story ended prematurely when an injury halfway along the trail forced them to return to town. Anyway, she couldn’t cast in the stiff armor. The last night before arriving back in Scandrow, the young men decided to make up for their unrealized treasure by lifting hers. On returning, empty-handed, Andi found that a week’s unannounced time off had cost her the library job. Furious and disappointed, Andi might have spent a good deal of time tracking those idiots down. Instead, before sunrise the following morning, frantic news all over the city made her personal matters seem small: fighting had broken out where her brother was stationed, and war had begun."}]}

He is a fighter class belonging to the human race."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-38 Edrik is born in a distant country of Tollaug.  A mountainous region, Tollaug was somewhat insulated from the brunt of aftermath of the Awakening but not from frequent wars with its neighbors. By the time Edrik was born Tollaug was fighting with three of its four neighbors. The bitterest war was with the largest country on their border, Garstin, and that war had last for hundreds of years.  The Tollaugens had needed to adapt their culture to survive and defend their homeland.  Nearly every able adult became a warrior in the Tollaugen military and by necessity the state overtook the responsibility for rearing children ((sort of Viking-style spartans but with primitive guns)).  Thus Edrik never knew his parents.  He grew up with his peers in the capital city of Belstein, raised to fight in a war that seemed would never end.  -26 Edrik saw his first battlefield when he was 12.  Belstein was seized by Garstin forces and he watched from the ramparts with his peers as his kinsmen fought then opposing forces.  Eager to punish the invaders he dedicated himself to his martial training.    -28-19 Though most recruits were not accepted into the military until they were 16, Edrik fought for and earned a position in their version of the assault infantry when he was still 14.    As one soldier in a battalion of hundreds he traveled over the mountains to fight on Garstin ground.  His notoriety grew within the unit, first due to his age and then due to the vicious efficiency with which he fought.  His only friends were the other members of his squad, though the brutality of the war meant he was frequently making new friends.  He earned their respect through his competence and willingness to keep them alive on the battlefield. By the time he was 17 he was made Captain of his squad.  -19-10 Eventually, Edrik's notoriety grew beyond his own battalion and he was reassigned to an experimental new unit: the Kitehawks.  Despite their military prowess, the Tollaugens were losing to the Garstin.  The Tollaugens had the larger military with better equipment, training, and officers but they had relatively few mages.  With their larger population the Garstin were able to embed mages regularly throughout their ranks and more than counter the advantage of the Tollaugens.  The mission of the Kitehawks was to infiltrate enemy territory before a battle and eliminate any prominent mages.  Initially the team had six members: Sigmar - Commander, Dwarf Male Fighter/Rogue, a cunning old warrior who was equally adept at battle and planning strategies.  Sigmar recruited each member of the Kitehawks personally and exercised a lot of autonomy in how the unit was operated.  The Kitehawks essentially belonged to Sigmar. ((Hannibal from A-Team)) Larin - XO, Half-Elf Female Rogue; a devious, clever spy who always seems to know what's going through someone else's head (and she might!), functions as the Kitehawk's intel officer ((probably a bit Garik-ish in that it's difficult to tell what side she's on sometimes)) Enger - Male Human Barbarian; a giant man with a gregarious attitude ((Armstrong from FMA)) Reivar - Male Human Ranger, a cunning woodsman and scout, a scary good sniper who used a custom built rifle to kill targets before he was ever seen. Known as \"Ghost\" by the enemy. ((Saito from GitS)) Edrik - Male Human Fighter, a relatively young fighter who proved quick to pick up new skills. He was trained by each of the members of the team, becoming something of a jack-of-all-trades for the squad. Halin - Female Gnome Rogue, a cheerful gnome, Halin seldom took part in the actual fighting but functioned as the squad's support officer.  She developed most of the custom equipment they used and arranged their transportation (often with a good deal of creativity) ((Prolly like that fellow in F4 Railroad))  Other members occasionally joined, died, or were reassigned but the team never numbered more than 9 and the 6 remained its core.  Edrik spent much of his time training with his teammates.  From Sigmar he learned battlefield tactics. From Enger he learned how to build his strength and hone his body. From Reivar he learned how to survive in nearly any environment.  Halin taught him much about their equipment and together the two of them constructed Hrunting, then a prototype.  But he may have learned most from Larin who taught him how to move without being seen.  Edrik grew very close to his teammates over the years and may have had a more than strictly professional relationship with Larin.  The squad itself was such a success that they, almost single-handedly, changed the scope of the war.  On a typical mission, Edrik and Larin would infiltrate the enemy's camp while Sigmar, Halin and Reivar observed from a distance, providing field support through \"comm MIs\".  Enger with his large size, was kept in reserve.  If a distraction was required or something went wrong, Enger and Sigmar could swoop in while Reivar raised some chaos from a distance.  Soon they were targeting more than just mages, taking out enemy commanders and officers as well.  Most often they would remove the corpse, or any other sign they had ever been there and leave the Garstin forces to wonder where their General or mage had disappeared to.  Sometimes they mutilated the corpse and prominently displayed it.  The Garstin tried many tactics, decoys, deployments, guards, but it seldom took the Kitehawks long to foil them.  When they began extracting high value targets, rather than killing them, the Tollaugens suddenly had a wealth of intel on their enemy.  The tide of the war began to swing and the Tollaugens took back territory they'd lost long ago and they swept into Garstin like a cutlass swings for a bare throat.  -10 Eventually the Tollaugens had fought right up to the Garstin capitol, Erba.  With the bulk of the Garstin military in ruins behind them their victory seemed assured.  The Kitehawks were sent in to capture the Garstin King, their most dangerous mission to date.  This time they all went into the field, taking different routes to meet up in the castle itself.  They fought/snuck to the King's chambers and found he was already dead, shot from a far through a window.  It was then, in the sanctity of the King's chambers, that Sigmar revealed his ultimate plan.  He had determined that Tollaug couldn't hold onto Garstin, the other country was just too large.  Whether they conquered Garstin or were conquered by Garstin their culture and people would be assimilated into the larger country.  What's more, Tollaug had been at war for so long that it had forgotten how to be at peace.  With the resources of Garstin they would be able to crush their other neighbors and would soon lose their own identity.  Sigmar's plan was to manipulate the political field, to make it seem as though the Garstin King were still alive and commanding the army but in order for his plan to work he would need to destroy most of the Tollaug army outside the city.  Hallig was the first to protest, arguing that even if Sigmar might be correct they couldn't kill their own countrymen.  The argument went back and forth for a few moments before Sigmar shot her.  At that point Edrick moved to draw his own pistol but a move from Larin stopped him.  Realizing he'd have to fight his own squad if he stayed, he grabbed Hallig's body (perhaps not realizing she was dead) and dove out the window.  He felt a bullet bite into his shoulder half-way to a river hundreds of feet below the castle keep.  He lost consciousness before he even hit the water.  When he woke up Hallig was nowhere to be seen.  The river had carried him far from the city and deposited him on a distant bank.  From where he sat he could see smoke and flame in the distance and the river around him had a distinct reddish hue.  It almost looked black in the morning light.  He had been shot in the back of his shoulder but his armor had kept him from bleeding out, barely.  He was too weak to search for Hallig and was forced to escape with whatever he happened to have on him.  He resolved that Edrick was killed in the fall and he would become someone else, abandoning his life to that day.  He never learned what became of the Kitehawks after that.  Sigmar's plan was complicated and Edrick never expected he'd heard all of it.  Explosions, either from magic or some hidden chemicals, destroyed 2/3s of the Tollaug army just as they broke the walls of the city.  The remainder fled back towards Tollaug but they were caught by the remains of the Garstin army.  Very few of those troops would ever return to their mountainous home.  Within the next few years Tollaug would be invaded again. They would repel that invasion, construct barricades, be invaded before the barricades were complete and according to myth an allegiance of the Garstin and the other enemies of the Tollaug were able to wipe them out. By -6 years the nation of Tollaug is no longer considered to exist.    -9 From the banks of a river in Garstin, he wandered without much purpose.  He turned his back to Tollaug and just kept walking south.  He found his way to a northernish forest ((similar to Pac NW maybe)) and began to live as a wildman.  The events in Erba had left him shattered, a wreck of his former self.  His body recovered in time but he had simultaneously lost every purpose he had.  Only his training and an inability to give up kept him going.  He reasoned he could live out the rest of his life in this remote place and never see another person.  By circumstance the cabin he built was close to a wolf's den.  He ran into the shaggy grey wolves from time to time but after their initial introduction they left each other alone.  The unspoken agreement was that he wouldn't interfere with the wolf or his bitch and they wouldn't try to eat his face.  That didn't stop the bitch's cubs from tromping through his cabin once they started leaving the den but he let them do as they would.  Months later a clan of trolls moved into their valley.  He came back to the cabin to find the wolf, wounded and bloody.  He followed it's trail to find a troll squatting by the wolf's den, eating the last of the cubs.  Enraged, he attacked the troll, calling on skills and training he hadn't used for a year.  When the troll's corpse smoldered next to the den he lit his own cabin, tossed the wolf over his shoulders, and moved on.  He nursed the wolf back to health since it seemed like the decent thing to do.  There after the wolf followed him, perhaps not quite a friend but a companion.  The wolf's wounds left it too weakened to survive on its own but he was content to provide it food in exchange for the company.  -8 The man and wolf seldom stayed in one place for terribly long.  It seemed everywhere they went there was something trying to eat them.  They didn't wish for much, just a place to live in solitude.  They avoided cities and people, keeping to the wild.  So it was a perhaps a surprise when the man found himself waking in a cage.  A box of iron bars, large and strong enough to hold an ogre, encased him and beyond it was an ornate chamber.  Walls decorated with art and trickling water forming delicate pools among polished stones.  Lush plants lined the room, leading the eye towards a great desk at the far side of the room where a young man sat.  At least, he seemed young and quite handsome.  His features made it difficult to discern if he were human or elf, probably a mingling of the two, but he exuded charisma and confidence.    His name was Kolan and he was a prominent officer within the Order of Scales; a quasi-religious institution outwardly dedicated to maintaining the balance in the world. The organization's roots lay somewhere beyond the Awakening but, like most things about them, were shrouded in mystery.  Kolan explained that they had preferred to guide civilization through subtlety but that they had had to change with the times.  They were now a global organization that, on the face of things, might seem like another religion with interests in trade.  In the shadows they did much more than pray and broker politics.    Kolan explained that he was recruiting him to hunt down a particular woman, a sorcerer who had once been a member of the Order.  Kolan suggested he was familiar with the Kitehawks and could contact them if so inclined.  He could arrange a reunion or assassination, whichever was more likely to motivate his captive.  So the man was coerced into adopting the identity of Gunnolf, a roaming bounty hunter specializing in retrieving, or eliminating, mages.  Once he had accepted this he was sent to a gnome named Zevan, another agent of the Order.  Zevan marked the back of Gunnolf's back hand with a symbol that would only appear under a magical lamp.  This would serve to mark Gunnolf as an agent of the Order to members of the Order but would otherwise be invisible.  Zevan equipped him as well, with armor and various magical items of some considerable worth.  Gunnolf learned that Zevan would be his handler and support officer, supplying him with information and equipment when he was undertaking missions directly for the Order.  Most of the time he would be undertaking public bounties and keeping an eye out for the sorceress.    And that's how a kid from a government school on the northern edge of the globe came to be a world-class bounty hunter of mage-types."}]}

There was a silent breeze drifting in from the north, causing Severus' cloak to flutter in the still air. He was standing upon the balcony atop the Senate building. It was a large oval building of marble, held up by columns of rune-inscribed white stone, which towered over the rest of the city. Severus was enjoying the spectacular view granted by the vista. He was clad in the traditional robes of the monarchian nobility, a pristine cloth coloured light blue trimmed with purple around the neck area. His back was covered in the cloak that was as dark crimson as the sky he was looking at. He turned and walked to the opposite side of the balcony which offered a different, if not as beautiful, view. Below him, he could see the senate floor where the hundred or so heads of nobility sat in discussion over the intricacies of tax collection. Occasionally a senator would rise from his seat and give a small speech on his opinion of the subject before sitting down to the applause of his supporters and the booing of his rivals. Nothing really changed until the final vote would be called, which would be at least another hour of tedious discussion by Severus' estimation. He sighed.  'Not the most interesting of sessions, is it?' asked a voice behind him. Severus turned and saw an older man in his fifties emerge from the stairs. He was wearing the same traditional clothing as Severus, although this had a golden trim down the middle of the robe, indicating an elected Senator. 'Ah, Senator Tullios.' he remarked. Severus smiled at the old politician, although he groaned inside. 'Always a pleasure. Please join me.' waving his hand to indicate the spot next to him.  'My father sends his thanks for your hospitality during his visit yesterday. He was very pleased that he expect your support during the next election.' said Severus as Tullios came to stand next to him, following his gaze down to the floor below. Tullios smiled. 'Ah, it was no trouble. My home has and will always be open to the Trevelyans.' He turned and looked at Severus. 'And how is the High Legate? I had expected to see him in session today.' Severus wanted to sigh, but he kept up his political correct facade and smiled. 'My father is well, thank you. He regrets that he could not attend session today, his duties as High Legate prevents him so. He is out in the field. You understand, I'm sure.' Tullios nodded. 'Ah, yes. The duties of high office, of course.' He said disappointed. 'I was hoping that he might propose a motion for me as a favour.' 'He did send Axios, however.' Severus cut in. 'My brother is a senator and has the full backing of my father and his supporters. Don't worry, Senator. We Trevelyans remember our friends.' He sighed slightly inwardly as he, yet again, quoted the old maxim. Severus never liked these political conversations. It was all promises, alliances, rivalries, and so it had been for the past three hundred years. One could never be upfront about anything, not even with those who you were publicly known to be friends with. Every relation was to be used as a tool to further ones own goals.  Tullios looked relieved 'Ah, excellent. That settles my worries so.' He looked down into the crowd of senators. 'I hope you will not be offended if I take my leave, I believe your brother Axios and I, have something to discussion.' Severus smiled, the first genuine smile at the old man. 'No offense taken. I understand completely. Please, give him my regards.'  Tullios vanished down the stairs soon after. Severus noticed that the sun had gone completely now and he stood alone on the light-less balcony. He flicked his wrist at the braziers around him, and fire began to consume them, providing a shadowed light. 'Bastard old goat.' he murmured.  'You shouldn't speak of our friends in such a tone, Severus' said a soft voice behind him. He smiled and turned, recognizing the voice. 'Elyria! Sister, it has been far too long.' he said as they embraced for a moment. 'How have your travels been? We didn't expect you home until next month.' She smiled. 'I got tired of the dreary weather down south. It was quaint for the first week but that novelty quickly wore off.' 'Please.' said Severus indicating the spot where Tullios had stood only a minute before. They looked down in the Senate where a small woman was making a surprising passionate speech about the importance of tax exemptions. 'Same as always.' Elyria mumbled. 'At least you have a chance to travel.' said Severus. 'If father has his way, it will be me in a couple of years who's down there making speeches.' 'If you want for adventure so much, just join the Skitarii, they can always use more men, and it is prestigeous.' she remarked 'Yeah and that is the problem. With fathers influence, I'll be an officer in a day, in two months I'll be commanding a whole brigade, and back to the politics, now with soldiers at my back. Oh yes, that would please him.' Severus said sarcastically. He sighed and leaned on the stone railing. 'No.. I need to leave Monarchia.' he stated with conviction.  They were quiet for a while, simply watching the proceedings below. Even the Archon himself looked bored at the whole thing. Severus noticed that Elyria was biting her lower lip, a tic she usually had when she was thinking. 'I may be able to help you, Severus.' She finally uttered. He looked at her curiously, waiting for her to elaborate. 'I came home early, not just because of the weather, but because I was asked to.. find somebody in Monarchia who would be willing to serve a greater purpose. I honestly doubted I'd find such a character in our Monarchia, but neither was I thinking of you.' she explained. Severus was about to speak, but she continued. 'This is not something you should take lightly, this is dangerous work. This.. might kill you if you're not careful.' She had a concerned look on her face. Severus knew her well enough to know that she rarely wore that particular expression. 'What have you gotten yourself into, Elyria?' he asked plainly. 'I can't say.' she said. 'But I need to know if you truely want this. Tell me you want the job, and I'll make sure you get it.' Severus paced back and forth, weighting his options. Elyria continued to watch the exchange in the Senate, almost ignorant of his dilemma. He finally stopped, standing at his regular spot again besides Elyria. His voice dropped to a whisper. 'And what about.. Him?' He asked quietly. Elyria looked up. 'What about Him?' she asked. 'Don't be coy.' Severus said, clearly annoyed. 'You know as well as I that we are bound to.. Him.' He had almost said it's name out loud. He fortunately had been able to hold his tongue, one does not utter the name of Ka'bantha without consequence. All the children of the Trevelyan family was bound to that creature when they turned 16. It was a family secret, one even not the closest friends of the family knew of. It was how the Trevelyans had risen to nobility some three-hundred years ago. Magical power was everything to the nobility of Monarchia, and the entire Senate below them were Wizards, Sorcerers and users of more exotic magics. Mages of all kinds were represented. Elyria smiled. 'Don't worry about Him, Severus. He is too busy with the schemes of the Nine Hells politics himself.' She shot him a glare. 'Just don't mention Him to anyone outside of Monarchia, they care as little for pacts with Devils as the narrow-minded fools down there.' she motioned to the floor below them. Severus nodded. 'I need time to think on this.' he stated. 'Can we meet tomorrow? Perhaps for breakfast?' 'Certainly.' replyed Elyria. 'I will see you tomorrow then, Severus.' 'Yes. See you there.' he said absent-minded and walked down the stairs, home to the family villa.   The next morning Severus strode into the atrium of the Trevelyan villa. It was a large open space, with a view to the clear sky where the morning sun was shining brightly. The servants bowed as he took place at the table sitting at the centre of the atrium, they quickly rushed out with plates filled with fruit, meats and breads. He poured himself a glass of wine and took a quiet sip. It was rather warm, likely having been left on the table since the last meal. If he desired he could have one of the servants whipped for that, but he remained silent and simply cooled the wine he was holding with a thought before taking  another sip. It was perfect temperature. 'You're up late.' said Elyria as she entered the atrium from the foyer. 'I've had a lot on my mind.' he said, sipping the wine, savoring the flavour as it touched his tongue and rolled around in his mouth before swallowing. He looked up at her as she took a seat and poured a glass for herself. 'I need to know more about this purpose you're suggesting.' Elyria sat the jug of wine down. 'Leave us.' she said to no one in particular as she snapped her fingers. Within moments the servants had left the atrium. She leaned forward and looked Severus in the eyes. 'I can't tell you much. But what I can say is that you'll likely be working with a team of people to find and investigate magical disturbances. That's all I can say.' Severus scuffed 'Why do they need me for that? Don't they have Wizards of their own?' he said mockingly. Elyria shot him a glare. 'You forget that outside of Monarchia, magicians are more rare than they are here. Their nobilities are not made up of mages like they are here.' she explained. 'Hm, maybe there's less arguing in the courts then.' he smiled. 'No, unfortunately there is just as much arguing there as in Monarchia.' She looked around. 'I've been asked by the Archon to attend the court in Forlos. I can take you with me and let you off in the capital, or maybe even one of the smaller towns on the way. It'll be no trouble.'  Severus thought about it for a long moment, before finally relenting. 'Very well, I shall accompany you to Forlos.' he paused. 'And see what this job you have for me is.' Elyria clapped her hands in excitement. 'Excellent! I'll make preparations immediately. We should be able to leave in a few days, I'll send word.' They both looked up as footsteps approached from the foyer, until Axios stepped into the atrium.  'Ah, Good morning you two.' he exclaimed as he took a seat at the head of the table. He looked around for a moment. 'Where has all the servants gone? Am I suppose to pour my own wine?' They all laughed at the joke. 'It wouldn't hurt with some humility once in a while, brother.' said Severus as Elyria snapped her fingers at a much louder volume that should have been naturally possible. Moments later, the servants hurried back into the atrium to attend them. 'Oh, I'm sure you're humble enough for both of us, Severus.' he said with a smile. 'Just as you have twice the ambition of the rest of us.' Severus retorted They laughed again. Elyria spoke up after a moments of silence. 'I was just telling Severus that the Archon had requested that I attend court in Forlos.' Axios eyes focused on her. 'Indeed? Forlos.. that is rather far away isn't it?' he said thoughtfully. Elyria nodded 'About two weeks travel with carriage. I've been there once before. A novel people, if rather..' She sighed 'Uncivilized.' Axios scoffed as if that was the most obvious thing in the world. 'She also suggested that I accompany her.' said Severus. Axios gazed at him with a rather surprised look. 'I was unaware that you wanted to play ambassador.' he remarked. 'I could have made arrangements.' he drained the rest of his glass in a single motion. Moments later the glass was full again, filled by a servant without a request. Axios didn't seem to notice it had ever been empty. Severus held up a hand. 'No no, it's quite alright. I'd rather see the people without having the duties of an ambassador hanging over my head. That was I may observe the proceedings with a clear mind.' Axios winked at him. 'Ahh I get it.' he said, likely without getting it. 'We'll be leaving at the end of the week.' said Elyria 'Sadly the Archon said that this was rather urgent.' Axios looked at Severus. 'I know you don't have any proper traveling clothes. We shall have to call the armourer and have him fashion the finest armour for you, Severus.' he proclaimed loudly. Severus was less than enthusiastic. 'That won't be necessary, Axios. Just some plain leather will do me fine. I don't want to outshine the entire court.' Axios laughed 'Non-sense, I insist!' that seemed to be the end of the discussion.  Three days later, Severus and Elyria was standing at the edge of the city in front of the city gates. The walls themselves surrounded Monarchia, with the nobilities villa having been built close to the Senate itself, with a marked district in the outer areas. The plebian population was mostly living outside the city-wall where a they were another city onto itself. The carriage that was to bring them to Forlos was rather plain. Severus approved. There were also four Skitarii guard which would escort Elyria on her official visit to Forlos. He looked at himself, in the armour that Axios had commissioned for him. He had been happy when he had seen it, for it was much more plain than he had expected from Axios. It was excellent quality, created to his exact dimensions, but lacking much of the decoration that Axios himself would have demanded. The only exception to this was the family crest which was embroidered onto the chest-piece of the armor: a fiery phoenix embracing a book. 'I listen to you more than you give me credit for.' said Axios with a smirk on his face. 'It would appear so.' said Severus before smiling at his brother. 'Thanks, Axios.'       'Don't mention it.' he said, extending his arm. Severus grasped it, holding his brother in a strong grip at the wrist, as his brother did the same. 'March with fortune.' they both said at once and broke the grip. 'Tell father, I'm sorry I couldn't say goodbye.' Severus said. Axios merely nodded. Axios and Elyria made their own goodbyes as Severus climbed into the carriage. He sighed heavily, filled with an excitement that he could barely contain and nervousness. Elyria climbed inside soon after. 'You can strike that grin off your face, I'm not looking at that for two week.'  When they reached the edge of the city-limited, Elyria fished out a letter from the satchel she was carrying and handed it to Severus. It was sealed in wax with her personal heraldry, a slight variation of his own fiery phoenix and book motif, as the stamp. 'Keep that close to you.' she said. 'It will be your entrance into the order when we arrive.' Severus raised an eyebrow at a mention of \"the order\" but from the fact that Elyria now seemed to ignore that any conversation took place, he merely smiled and put the letter in his own satchel bag.

He worked on his family’s ship throughout his childhood and teen years and is very comfortable on the sea. When he was 15 his family’s ship was attacked by pirates and most of the crew and his family was put to the sword…he escaped with his life because he was knocked unconscious by a sword blow to his head (causing a scar and seemingly dead eye). He awoke shivering in the cold water, floating on the debris of his family’s ship, and was discovered by a member of the Order of the Flagon. The Order of the Flagon is a monastic order that resides at the Iron Keep, a small former military stronghold on Omans Isle. Scale, the monk who rescued him, gave Caul the name Shivers because of how he was found.   The Order of the Flagon is comprised of ex-military and sailors who have tired of their former lives and seek deeper meaning to their existence. At the Iron Keep the monks focus on a number of things: training their minds and bodies to be weapons, harnessing potential innate magical abilities, assisting all those who may need it, maintaining a proper sense of humor about most things (they consider that the only appropriate response to the randomness of the world), and brewing ale so good that a sip may help you see the workings of the universe…they tend to drink their brew pretty heavily. During his years there, Caul discovered an affinity for martial arts, both empty-handed and with a quarterstaff, as well as some innate druid magical ability; he also became the assistant brewer for the order by the time he was 20.  The tradition of the Order dictates that individual members go forth into the world for at least 2 years in order to enhance their fighting training, help those who need it, and to research ingredients and techniques to experiment with new beer recipes and styles. Caul left the order at the age of 24 and has now been traveling the Sword Coast for one year. He is currently in Waterdeep working as a bouncer at a popular waterfront tavern and brewery called the Besotted Beholder and experimenting with their brew system whenever he gets a chance.   Caul carries a long carved ironwood mash paddle that he uses as a quarterstaff when fighting. It is carved down from an oar that he was clutching after the his family's ship was destroyed. It is reinforced with iron strips along the sides and wrapped in leather at several points. "}]}

Rhalia is a rogue belonging to the human race."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rhalia's life was turned upside-down the night The Orc Lord of Laerhaven attacked her home town. Lander, Captain of the City Guard; her husband and father to their 10-year-old son, Valen, was killed in the attack. As the Orc Lord's raiders ransacked the town, Rhalia hid Valen away in their home before being captured and taken prisoner to be used as a slave in Laerhaven's dungeons. Using a warlock's powers, she, and the rest of the slaves, were kept under control. If one tried to escape, a location spell would easily track them down and punishment would be severe.  As time went on in the dungeons, Rhalia became hardened by her mistreatment. She spent her time studying the filth and scum that inhabited the city of Laerhaven. A thief and charlatan named Jakobi was also imprisoned after trying to cheat a trader in town. Rhalia grew close to him and learned many skills and tricks. They learned the nature of the spells and traps used to keep the slaves under control. They learned the limitations and extent of those as well.  Her heart mourned for her home and family but Jakobi was a much needed helping hand. Soon she became pregnant. She knew that there would be no chance of survival for her child should she be discovered. She feigned injuries and illnesses- just enough to keep her from working but not to be considered useless- to keep her pregnancy secret. The orcs were ruthless but they were not that smart. On the final night of her pregnancy, Jakobi did the unthinkable for her. He attempted an escape in order to distract the guards long enough from the cries of the child being born; and to buy Rhalia enough time to smuggle her away from the city.  Rhalia had connections outside the city walls. An entity known only as \"Grandmother Night\" had kept her and Jakobi supplied with tools and food while they were imprisoned. A troupe of travling lightfoot halflings was dispatched to help smuggle a package out of Laerhaven's dungeons. The package they received was not the one they were expecting. It was an infant girl named Joy Beestinger. As Rhalia watched her daughter taken away to safety, she turned and ran back towards Jakobi's planned escape route. She arrived in time to see Jakobi on his knees, captured by the barbaric guards. She watched in horror as he turned to her and winked just as a sword was plunged into his chest. She knew not to scream. She only cried.  Years passed and finally, it was time. Under the cover of darkness, Rhalia led a small group of slaves through the sewers but not towards the outside walls. They emerged in the basement of Laerhaven's fortified hall. They slaughtered the bodyguards in silence. They butchered the warlock in his sleep. Only the Orc Lord remained. Rhalia would slice his throat herself. She was cold and unfeeling as the life seeped from the wound and onto the filthy sheets of the giant bed. The Orc Lord was no more. They were slaves, no more.  \"Mother. Forgive me. You raised me better than this.\" She muttered as a small figure met her outside the town walls. The smell of baked goods and honey met her nostrils.  \"Nonsense, child.\" The halfling woman stepped into the moonlight. \"I raised you to fight for what you believe in and do what is right. The same things you taught your own child, whom you should see, by the way. He's so handsome!\"  \"Valen is alive?!\" Rhalia's knees buckled and she fell in front of her mother. \"But.. I had not thought of him- I didn't believe he could be..\" Her mother's small hand on her shoulder steadied her.  \"Alive and well. As is.. Joey?\" She added.  \"Joey?\" Rhalia looked puzzled for a second but smiled again as tears streamed down her face. \"Joy. Her name is Joy. My Joy.\" She closed her eyes and remembered the words of Jakobi. (\"You are my joy.\")  \"Go to them, my dear sweet child.\"  \"Yes, mama.\" Rhalia breathed in her first deep breath of freedom in very long. \"I will go to my children. Thank you for everything, mama. I love you.\"  \"I love you, too.\" Said the small woman, holding a staff out for Rhalia to take. \"You'll need this.\" She smiled. \"Oh! And these. You look hungry, dear, eat before you set out.\" She handed Rhalia a sweet-smelling bundle wrapped in an elegant kerchief and with that, seemed to disappear into the shadows.  Rhalia smiled and sighed as she looked up to the heavens. She would need money to travel.. and armor.. and more weapons. She knew just where to go."}]}

She was discovered amongst a number of ill-treated prisoners in ragged clothing kept hostage by a group of insane cultists of the Great Old Ones some years ago.  On the surface she seems to be child-like, her way of speaking and mannerisms playful and whimsical, talking of playmates, friends, tea parties, candies, cakes, cute puppies and kittens, that sort of thing.  Over the past several years, however, her once placid and innocent behavior has descended into greater and greater violence. While once it may have been that her imaginary friends were just that, imaginary, it seems that the stars have aligned and something dark whispers to Tulip.  \"Tea party\" seems to equivocate to severe violence perpetrated by the tea party hosts upon the guests, who are then sent to \"The Grandest Tea Party of Them all,\" whatever that is.  She was discovered living quite happily amongst the corpses of the two dozen or so patients and six staff, covered in blood, drawing dark and arcane sigils on the walls, amidst drawings of the happy and pleasant things her speech is often peppered with.  The bodies revealed that they did not died pleasantly, set upon and partially devoured by beasts with claws and fangs. Tulip was certainly not responsible for this, instead somehow managing to summon vile creatures into being. The only one left behind was an animated skeleton Tulip dubbed \"Mr. Buttons,\" who she made herself.  One of her imaginary friends, whom she calls the Lady in Shade, told her that she was meant to be a princess. Tulip decided that as a princess, she needed a butler. So she made one.  Obviously mentally ill, Tulip was then placed in far stricter and more controlled medical care. Pages upon pages are devoted to conversions between Tulip and her primary care doctor and read as a descent from a good and noble doctor into a mad lunatic seeking to curry favor from dark powers from beyond time and space.  Tulip, apparently, had learned how to spread her warped state of mind at a touch. Once again she was discovered happily amongst a massacre, quite contently having dinner, dressed in a ball gown, being doted on by her followers amidst the patients and staff who had turned fearsome cultists who regarded her as a gateway of power and insight from their new dark masters.  Tulip was exorcised, a dark spirit that amplified her power driven from her. That did not, however, prevent her from once again murdering a careless guard and recreating Mr. Buttons.  No longer thought of as merely mentally ill, Tulip has been sentenced to death for her part in the blasphemous murder and ritualistic sacrifice of the staff and patients of the hospice that did not come under sway of the cult.  She doesn't quite seem to understand her fate. She insists that she be given her dress back, as she has a ball to attend. She is a princess, and she is finding this time out very inconvenient. And also boring. She's also lost her puppy, he flies, you know."}]}

He was barely a hatchling when an adventuring party wiped out his home den and set him adrift in the surface world. Lonely, tiny, half blind, and desperate, Pike somehow found his way into the lair of an Ancient Silver Dragon, Shamalundith, and her mate, Koriasith. Taking pity on the tiny creature, Shamalundith took him in and raised him as if he were a hatchling, and now, Pike fully believes himself to be a silver dragon. He would often wander into the nearby town, keeping low and to the sides, just to examine the melting pot of creatures and to sate his natural curiosity. He discovered his draconic blood around the age of 4, and began practicing the art of sorcery with the help of Shamalundith, and even though his draconic blood wasn't inherently Silver, he was so disheartned and confused that Shamalundith and Koriasith wove a spell to alter it. He is now a proficient burglar and fledgling sorcerer, much to the chagrin of Shamalundith, and he gives his all in an attempt to build his own little hoard. Shamalundith has been a huge impact in his life, teaching him how to control his magic, how be use a blade, how to survive, but most of all, how to respect life. On the 6th anniversary of his appearance in her cave, Shamalundith gifted Pike with a set of adventuring gear sized for him and a magic bag to hold his little treasure hoard before sending him out into the world to carve his own destiny. He still often returns home to visit his mother and deposit what he has earned or stolen onto his ever growing little hoard. "}]}

Her parents are both hunters, and her three sisters are a healer, the tribe's lorekeeper, and a gatherer, respectively.  Ora has been training in combat and hunting since she was old enough to hold a weapon and bait a trap, and she has put forth effort to assist her tribe as both a warrior and a hunter when needed. After a disastrously failed romance with another member of the tribe, the social politics of tribal living began to grate on her; at 120 years young Ora began taking to the wilderness for increasingly longer spans of time, returning only to the tribe to bring supplies and share a meal before departing again. She has spent the last 30 years working as a trapper and fur trader, and routinely travels great distances in the name of exploration and trade. She has done a great deal of business with people from the South, and has spent years learning Quaren to aid in her endeavors.  Ora enjoys exploring the land, and places high value in accumulating as many experiences as she can. She isn't particularly persuasive or diplomatic, but her skinning technique is exceptional, so her furs typically fetch a good price. Though she has a temper, she can usually be calmed by a large mug of ale, and is otherwise a generally low-maintenance person. She has poor social skills, very little sense of when to hold her tongue, and no patience for flattery or intrigue.  Ora has just reached the town of Stonneford with a pack full of furs, and she’s looking for a distraction after a troublesome argument with her family about her lifestyle during her last visit.

The key difference is that the Burning Sun add the extraordinary caveat that strength must be used in protection of the weak. The weak must still know their place and serve the strong, but the relationship is reciprocal. Every Burning Sun Orc knows this and considers the defense of the weak to be a sacred duty. Then there is Shegardis Darkcrusher, for whom duty has became an obsessive mania. Even with the Burning Sun barely holding their own against enemies on every side, Shegardis could not stand the idea that those same enemies oppressed scores of others beyond her reach and outside her protection. So she has set out across Belkzen's unforgiving wastes, interposing herself between the abused and their abusers wherever she finds them. Every beating she takes only makes her faith in Sarenrae stronger. Every battle she survives only reassures her she is on the right path. She doesn't know much, but she knows that strength is more than just hitting the hardest: it is being able to stand after the hardest hit lands on you. She has no illusions about her own survival, living this way. But that is the burden such strength brings. As befits a paladin of the Dawnflower, Shegardis always gives her foes a chance to back down, if possible. Whether through parlay or intimidation, she wants her foes to know what they are up against. Since cowards never dare engage someone stronger than they, Shegardis is developing ways to make her foes come to her whether they will it or no. If she can live long enough to perfect these techniques, then the downtrodden of Belkzen will have a formidable defender indeed. Shegardis would love to polish her armor to a brazen shine and brush her thick hair to its full luster. But she knows what Orcs respect and fear, and so she leaves the metal dark and bloodstained, rarely brushes the filthy mats from her hair, and dons the fierce warpaint of a Belkzen reaver.

As with many in the Order of the Timeless Plan, Nina was born into the life, schooled in matters both religious and worldly from a young age, and in matters more martial once she reached her teenaged years.  Although she longed for a true test of her skills, Nina, befitting her status as a junior member, was mostly sent on supply runs, both to the nearby Rajashi, and occasionally to Lionguard for wares unavailable in the desert city. It was on one such supply run that word was sent to her of a nearby encampment of bandits, and as she was the nearest member of the Order in the area, she was instructed to reconnoiter their camp—and reconnoiter only, unless attacked or otherwise absolutely necessary.  Unfortunately for her, an ill-timed sneeze gave away her presence, and she was swiftly captured. Rather than fight, however, she walked willingly with her captors into her cage, so that she could have time to formulate an escape plan, thankful that her simple garb seemed to have caused the bandits to take her for a common courier.  After several days—and several plans thought up, mulled over, and discarded—a new variable entered the arena: Another adventurer. Many of the plans she had tossed out, she had done so precisely because they would have required a second person. Now, however, she could put one of them into action; She saw her chance, and she took it, and with the aid of the adventurer, she was free of her captivity. Out of gratitude—and also out of a desire for both a bit of action and a bit of revenge—she pledged to help the adventurers' group to destroy the bandit camp, though once the task was done, she set out to return to Stonehold.  On the way there, however, she found the holy symbol of someone else in her order dangling from a bush, and followed a red light in the distance—one that led her right back where she came. Confused as h*ck, she decided the best course of action was to rejoin the group, see the world, and hope to send a message to Stonehold in the next few days."}]}

Bursting with vibrant energy and endless curiosity, Plume grew up to be a very agitated and restless child. Their parents decided that they should follow the training of Sweet Zephyr, also known as Master Zeph', to become one of the monk soldiers who protect the Clan. Maybe Zephyr would manage to channel Plume's spiritedness into something useful and honorable!  After two years of learning the monks' martial art techniques and philosophy, Plume began to get bored of the zen teachings. They enjoyed the exhausting fighting exercises and the straining activities to improve one's control over their body… But it wasn't worth all of the meditation, and contemplation, and deference, and self-reflection, and obedience, and *urgh*. There just wasn't enough action. The prospect of spending the next few decades staying in the same place, defending their clan against the same easily-defeated threats (orc clans and savage beasts, for the most part) was quickly becoming depressing.  They wanted to be a bug. Like, a beautiful spider, or a tiny sandfly. They had always been fascinated by insects. Their ability to crawl or fly everywhere they wanted, while staying completely silent and unnoticed, was the most captivating thing ever. The quiet strength of ants or beetles, and the stubbornness they seemed to irradiate, was inspiring. They wanted to be able to scuttle like those bugs. Fast, and chaotic, and powerful, and swift, and focused, all at once.  One day, they had enough of being disciplined in front of the other students for (again) not being able to keep still during the daily meditation session. They felt a small butterfly land on their ankle, so of course they opened their eyes to see what color it was and where it was going next! But apparently nobody understood how pretty and enchanting it was. Punishments, like trainings, were physically bearable — Plume was a strong, well-build Tabaxi — but Master Zeph' used only the most boring chores as punishments for Plume. This time wasn't particularly bad (Plume had sorted and washed kilograms of mushrooms before) but it was the last straw.  So they put their stuff in a hastily-made bag, left a short note for Master Zeph' (« Thank you for your teachings. I don't think I can find my inner peace at the dojo, or ever be a satisfying Breeze Soldier. I wish you well. »), another for their parents (« I want to see what the bugs look like in other parts of the world. I'll probably come back to show you at some point. I love you. »), and they left in the direction the wind was blowing.  They spent the next two years travelling around aimlessly, watching interesting bugs, hiding from ugly-looking creatures, running across plains at night and sleeping in trees during the day. They started earning a dime escorting merchants when they wanted to travel across inhospitable lands, and eventually ended up at Aldranos.   They had expected to hate the city (villages were in general pretty boring: they always felt like the weird stranger, and the flies buzzing around farms and trash piles were much less interesting than the colorful insects they found in nature). Much to their surprise, they realized that they quite liked it. They weren't the only exotic race there, big buildings meant shadows everywhere, and there were plenty opportunity to get in all kinds of fun trouble.  Running low on cash, they decided to answer a job posting for a security gig at some kind of party organized by an elven Lord. The place was super fancy, so it would probably be boring, but it paid well, and they got to wear a beautiful uniform, full of bright colors that made them look like a crossing between a dragonfly, a ladybug and a jaguar. Hopefully they could keep it afterwards!"}]}

A pair of humans found her as she wandered alone, hungry and scared. This couple took Storie in and raised her as their own.   Storie's parents owned a small item shop near Unity's center. From an early age Storie acted as a sort of scout, finding abandoned things or picking various herbs outside Unity's gates to be sold in the shop. As she grew older she was allowed to go further from home in these expeditions.   During one such trip at age 16 Storie happened across a wounded animal while looking for a rare flower often used in dyes. She knew there was a small town nearby so she took the animal there in hopes that it's owner was among the residents.   As she approached the gates she was accosted by another creature; this one small, capable of flight and shrilly chattering at her. It seemed angry.   It was ADORABLE! Storie immediately decided that she needed to adopt one.  While she sought out the wounded animal's owner she discovered that the \"adorable flying angry thing,\" as she described it, was a pseudodragon bonded to the local Warlock.   The wounded animal belonged to the local blacksmith. He was very grateful that Storie had found it; it had been missing for several days and he had feared the worst. The blacksmith was more than happy to introduce her to the Warlock in return for her timely rescue.  The Warlock found Storie unimpressive and initially dismissed her. \"You can't be a Warlock just to have an 'adorable' pet!\" he scolded. Storie persisted, however, and eventually he told her that if she could find a patron he would accept and train her.   It took three long years of apprenticeship before he would allow her to attempt to gain a familiar but she did eventually bond her own pseudodragon. She named her new friend Charme.   During these years she had continued to help with her parents' shop, taking on a formal job acquiring stock for them. They were not excited about her decision to take up such a \"dark art\" but it made her happy and her bright, always helpful personality never changed. They eventually accepted her choice.   Charme helped. Such an endearing mascot drew in more customers.   Four years after she left her apprenticeship Storie's parents sent her on a trip across the land to purchase and bring back some rare reagents a visiting Sorceress had ordered.   During the trip the train she was on was accosted by the Emperor's personal guards. Storie was roughly dragged from her seat and knocked unconscious. When she awoke she found herself in some sort of jail cell.   The man across the hall, a Bard named Lind, provided the details. She had been dragged in by the local guard and added to some list as \"Family of people known to be working with the Rebellion.\"   Storie had no idea what this rebellion was or if her parents were secretly working for it but she knew one thing: Those guards were likely after her parents now. If she could get out of here then she was going to find this rebellion and rescue her family. "}]}

When Dax’s parents passed away and Dax inherited the store, he was dedicated to maintaining and building on his father’s legacy. He had some moderate success in running the business on his own. The store was more profitable than ever.  After being on his own for about a decade, he began to itch for something else to do with his time. He really wanted to give more back to his community. There was a particular alderman named Edward Mardog. Alderman Mardog was uniformly disliked by the townspeople and his seat was up for reelection.

Her mother said once that her grandmother joined the Druidic tradition in atonement for a crime against nature by infernal ancestors, but Anthy didn't listen very close and doesn't remember the details.  They did not live in complete isolation. Anthy's mother was a skilled apocethary and sold herbs, potions, and even poisons to those who sought her out.

Her mother played up the aura of fear and mystery from her Tiefling features and magic to keep trade terms agreeable and to protect them, maintaining a dramatic \"witch\" persona. Anthy took to her mother's art and soon did the bulk of the potion brewing, but considered the theatrics more of a fun game than a necessity. Her mother often said they must be self-reliant due to their race, but Anthy found it hard to believe people are as cruel as her mother claims.  A few months back, her mother left abruptly at the call of The Splintered Oak, a Druidic organization.

Her shock was broken by a crossbow bolt grazing her horn and soldiers rushing at her. Calling upon the swamp to entangle them, she hastily retreated into the bogs where they could not hope to track her.

My sapphire-blue eyes and dark blue hair must have been unnerving against my ruddy skin, and my mother abandoned me on the steps of the Cleric healer's convent of Pelor ((also called Al'Asran), the god of the Sun. Older man, golden hair and beard, shining white clothing) a few hours up the mountain outside of town. She probably thought that, as holy people, they would dispose of me.   Instead they sought to change my negative past into a positive and named me Gold-Heart, taking me under their wings. I was raised by the Clerics, and tried to take their path.   I had little skill for it, however. Rather, I had little patience for the rituals and little interest in memorizing the complex prayers, preferring to spend my time with wounded children and cheer them up. The nurses didn't begrudge it-in fact most of them were grateful that the children had someone their age to play with and keep them occupied, as they prefered to tend to the adult wounded. When I was nine this became easier as my talents as a Sorceress made themselves known. One night I was dealing with a child in particularly bad pain-I believe she had been cursed, and the matrons were having difficulty naming it in order to produce a counter.   One of the elder Clerics, a stuffy man with little sense of humor, came into the room and asked me curtly to make sure the girl, only about five, 'kept it down' so he could attend to a passing noble with a flesh wound.   Understandably, the girl was embarrassed and I was angry at his obvious lack of concern for those with less money. I wanted to punish him-but mostly I wanted to cheer the girl up. I wished suddenly and intensly that I could scare the living daylights out of the old bastard! The ability to manifest the illusion of a spider the size of a dog, I thought, would be hysterical.  And suddenly a spider the size of a dog appeared in front of him. He let out a loud shriek and stumbled backwards-the girl was frightened for just a moment but she saw the grin on my face and must have realized it was my thoughts creating the spider. She started giggling and clapping her hands. I was sent to bed that night without dessert by the elder-but some of the nurses brought me up some after lights out time.   Thereafter I got the nickname \"Mischief\" for the subtle pranks I played on the staff members and some of the better humored patients. By then I knew about Tiefling heritage and that a Valor name is usually taken, and I thought this one particularly fantastic so I adopted it as my first name. None of my caretakers objected.   As a convent, we had plenty of books, and I trained myself in the way of a few basic spells and cantrips. One of the elder men at the convent had a few adventures under his belt and happily taught me staff fighting.  Whether he wanted to relive his glory days or give me a suitable and safe outlet for my energy I know not.   Another ten years went by and I grew more and more restless--I was still a Tiefling, after all, and my penchant for causing Mischief (however well-meant)  was also growing to be more and more of a pain for the Clerics. Still, they always appreciated that I kept the children happy whenver I could.  When a visiting Paladin nobleman came through the convent and offered to take me adventuring with him, I doubt he expected me to nearly jump on him with enthusiasm-but I did.    "}]}

Khari is a tiefling rogue."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It came as no surprise to the young tiefling, Khari, when he was sat down in front of his parents and told that he was adopted. He had already suspected as such, being that one parent was an elf and the other was a half-orc, and neither was inclined toward any sort of infernal arts. The fact that they were lesbians would normally have clued him in as well, but at such a young age, he didn't quite make the connection. They told him that he was found as a young toddler, unconcious and abandoned in the desert wastes by a passing trade caravan, where he was taken to the tiny backwater town of Dust. Truth be told, the news didn't exactly change anything for Khari. With such a low population in general, there were only a couple other tieflings in town, and Khari, specifically, was the only imp-spawn, so he already felt like an outcast. As he grew older, Khari rebelled against his loving parents, and with Dust having a very short arm of the law, the tiefling garnered quite a reputation for bringing trouble wherever he went. Eventually, however, that trouble caught up with him, when, one summer night, a short series of misadventures ended with a stable fire. The fire killed many of the town's horses, and the blame was placed on Khari. Dust's old Sheriff had had enough, and Khari found his arms shackled in cold iron for the first time in his life. Khari was to wait in the Sheriff's jail until the local Marshall could take him to trial, but with the threat of severe punishment on the horizon, Khari managed to pull out one of his teeth and use it to pick the primative lock on his cell door and escape into the night. Catching up to a trade caravan that had just left town, Khari managed to hitch a ride to the nearest port harbor of Starboard. The tiefling wasn't prepared to be on the run, however, and tried to steal some food once he had arrived, but was quickly noticed. It seemed that the bustling city was all too familiar with Khari's brand of trouble. The tiefling managed to evade capture, but he was afraid that the chase would bring notice of his presence to the Marshall that would be hunting him down, so Khari snuck aboard a trade ship and waited until they were out at sea to reveal himself. In the nature of Khari's ever evolving string of bad luck, it turned out that the ship he found himself on was crewed by a group of pirates that weren't too happy at the notion of being a taxi service. Instead, they alleviated that frustration by pressing Khari into their gang. The imp-spawn, of course, hated it. He was stripped of his belongings and forced to work the gross, menial tasks that the ship needed performed. As such, he continued to cause trouble for the crew, picking fights and spreading mischief. But, as time went on, the pain of servitude lessened, both from familiarity and from climbing in the crew's duties, and Khari began to work alongside the crew instead of against them, coming to even enjoy his life as a pirate. The tiefling began to see the rest of the crew as something of another surrogate family, and they saw him as the little devil imp they had adopted. This too, unfortunately, wasn't meant to last. Around the time that Khari finally came of age, he became distracted while performing his duties in the crow's nest, and a Captial Navy vessel crept up on them, opening fire in the dead of night while most of the crew slept. The ship ended up sinking, but having gone down relatively near Aurias' western coast, it was thought that there might have been survivors. And so it was, as Khari eventually drifted to shore, alone and afraid. After a day of wandering, he stumbled upon an old cottage, where an elderly man helped nurse him back to health. Not wanting to bring attention to himself, Khari pretended to suffer from amnesia. After a couple of days of rest, a Naval official pounded on the cottege door, and asked the man if he had encountered any survivors of the battle. The old man surprised Khari by denying any strange visitors or happenstance, sending the official away. While the old man believed that it was likely that Khari was, in fact, one of the shipwrecked pirates, he believed that in his amnesiatic state, he could start a new leaf and leave that troubled life behind. This entire time, Khari had gone nameless to the old man, in order to keep up his ruse. It was at this point that the old man suggested that the tiefling adopt the name Trouble. He admitted it was a bit superstitious, but he thought that perhaps by placing his \"troubles\" at the forefront of his person, he could avoid it affecting him as it so clearly had in what they believed to be his past life. The imp-spawn took the name, and agreed to be led to the nearby city of Height, in order to truly find his new lot in life. As soon as the old man left the newly christened Trouble to his own devices, however, the tiefling almost immediately fell back to the only way of life he really knew. With naught to his name, he started raiding food stores, and ended up running into the local underground in the process. Asking to work with the group, he started working his way up the ranks of the criminal world, much like he had on the pirate ship. *** It has been two years since he first came to Height, and in the process has worked a lot of easier jobs, like lookout and bagman, as he properly learned the trade of larceny. Caught on a charge of loitering (while casing out a joint), Trouble ended up working a job for Height's High Mage, and in the process ended up saving the city. This had the unfortunate effect of putting his face out there for the city to see, but even the criminal element was grateful for his efforts. After seeing what he was capable of, Trouble was promoted to a full, proper thief in the organization, and now works with DAN THE HARVESTER, using the lich as a fence. Trouble loves his new life, and has grown attached to the people of his organization, people who he's tempted to call his third family. He even greatly enjoys the thrill of working for the \"good guys\", and there's always a grin on his face when Va'al drops by for a visit. But much like his other adventures, he's sure that it's just a matter of time before his troubles catch up to him once again, and then this too, will end. Only time will tell how messy it will be, if Trouble's luck of escaping it even continues at all."}]}

Noya is a sorcerer of the tiefling race."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " What should have been a wonderful day turned into quite a shock. Although her mother was fair and charming and her father was strong and rugged, Cináed took it to an extreme. She was born with a Infernal and a Primordial Bloodline by no choice of her own, but just the funny coincidence that the exact time that those curses or blessings would surface in one body, hers. In contrast her twin brother who came out only minutes later had no strange features at all.  As you might imagine this has the potential for a lot of trouble. Since tieflings are almost universally hated or treated with prejudice, because of a certain stunt Asmodeus pulled claiming all tieflings as his own and changing their appearance to be more devilish. Furthermore primordials are known for their wanton destruction and selfishness. Though one thing stood against that all the one thing you could call a bright spot in this amalgamation of negativity, her incredible beauty and this caused some trouble of its own.  Noya Cináed Coldsplitter was born in Waterdeep, the City of Splendor. She lived in the South ward, the poor section of the city. Her father was a dockworker, until he died by a falling crate when she was 15, and her mother is a seamstress. Although they were poor they did manage to get by and not go hungry all the time, which is quite a feat considering she had six siblings.  So from a young age Noya had to help her mother with her craft which kept her conveniently away from the children who teased and bullied her about her appearance and her lack of a shadow. The times she didn’t have to help her mother were less pleasant, however her brother was always there to support and defend her.  Contrary to what one might think about her personality Noya was actually quite outgoing and mischievous. Frequently getting into trouble because of the pranks she pulled with her magic. Though she quite often managed to get away with it because she was so cute and charming then. However it’s unsure if it was her own charm or her magical talent. Her brother wasn’t so lucky, but she never let him get punished from the things she did or they both did. Not all pranks ended so fortunate. One time at the age of nine when pranking a merchant with an illusionary sound the horse startled and ran her over. This incident caused her to almost lose her life, leaving her within an inch of death.If it wasn’t for her supernatural toughness she would have been no more.   While there was a great downside to her injuries, she was bedridden for many months, there was also an upside. Noya became more adept at sewing and making clothes, even designing them. Although there was little opportunity for the latter, because of their low wealth.  Eventually in later years she managed to attract attention for her works by a more famous seamstress, dressmaker or tailor called Madeleine. Whatever you wanted to call it, she was good at it. Madeleine was really what got Noya into tailoring and dressmaking. Madeleine taught her the tricks of the trade and mentored her. She introduced Noya to the high society and taught her how to behave in such company. While simultaneously modeling the garments, with her brother, her mistress created in exchange for her apprenticeship. This and an extra stipend allowed her parents and her siblings to live more comfortable and not have to slave away at their jobs, though they preferred to continue their professions.  Of course this got Noya in touch with the noble’s son and daughters some of which took a fancy to her, while others were put off by her appearance. In her early teens Noya learned a bit more about some noble’s sons, but it was never more than that. At her 15th year a horrible event occurred. Noya’s father was killed in an accident at the docks. Getting crushed under a crate his death was swift, but the consequences were not. This event had a profound effect on Noya. Her father, Malcer, was her rock. If she ever needed help he was there for her. That was now gone and she didn’t handle it well. One noble son took advantage of her vulnerability and with his charm he managed to gain her interest. During the dance, one of the many she had attended in name of her mistress, Madeleine, the noble’s son grew impatient. The reason he had approached her was because of her beauty and exoticness. Noya was to be another mark on his post. One more in a long line of defiled girls. One more girl to boast about to his friends. After a few hours he tried to coerce and pull her into the gardens. The gardens wherein so many girls before her had lost their innocence, but Noya did not want to be one of them. She resisted and pulled back, but her strength then was not what it is now and she couldn’t stop him. That is when she revealed her magical ability and she viciously mocked his charm, his manners and his appearance leaving him spitting blood and it enabled her to escape from his grasp long enough for her brother to come her side and defend her. The noble’s son being humiliated in public so audibly fled in his shame and he still holds a grudge against Noya to this day.  Rumors were spread about Noya, her being a devil’s child and dancing naked under the moon singing in prayer to her patron and on other days she would supposedly cut open babies and eat their hearts. People avoided her for this for a while, but not everyone was so susceptible to the ridiculous rumors. A small group either not caring about her enough to believe the rumors or knowing Noya enough that they were false. One such a boy attracted her attention. His name was Torlyn Wands and he was seemingly unaffected by both her appearance and her magical abilities. Which of course was the result of his familiarity with this. It is he whom she gave her innocence on her sixteenth birthday and it was he who she planned to marry when she became eighteen. However it was not to be, the closer Noya got to eighteen the more restrained their relationship became. Until he at last confessed to her the impossibility of their marriage due to the pressure his family put upon him to instead marry a girl with a less ill repute. Heartbroken she could not stand being in Waterdeep where such precious memories lay dormant, but also great pains, so she left the city seeking means elsewhere.  The years after she spend traveling from city to city finding work as a seamstress, before eventually traveling further, because no city was like home. On her travel she occasionally had troubles with bandits and monsters and had to reveal her magical talents to fight them off. Something she preferred not to do, because it would gain her unwanted attention. Which Noya already got enough of if not for her beauty, it was for her devilish or elemental appearance. What she not wanted did eventually happen when she was 21. In the city of Neverwinter Noya was accosted by a drunk merchant in a particularly high-end establishment. No matter what she did, from polite refusal to angry shoving, nothing worked. Eventually she told him to take a hike with more force than normal and as soon as she was done the man turned around abruptly and walked out of the establishment to the astonishment of a lot of people inside. To be using magic so blatantly and openly on another citizen is not something many would dare. Realizing what she had done, Noya quickly gathered her belongings and fled the building. She started making her way home making sure not to take a direct path to make it more difficult for anyone to follow her. It took Noya a while to get there. However finally at home she wasn’t alone. A man was inside and he offered her a proposition to join their organization and they would help her stay away from the guards that time. This is how she got to work with the Order of the Star Mages and it is how she got where she is today."}]}

Sebastian is a tiefling sorcerer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In a backwards land, a small and insignificant lord tried to summon a Devil to try and become a Warlock. Unfortunately he was tricked by the Wizard that sold him the ritual (or the Wizard was way less capable than he believed) and instead ended up face to face with a Demon not interested in upholding any side of any contract. Some time after the failed attempt, a child birth is preceded by all kinds of strange events: 9 goats started ramming their heads against rocks until killed, black, distorted frogs rained from the clear sky out of nowhere, all milk turned sour as soon as the sun went away, kids refused to make any sound for the whole night and every domesticated animal ran away from the mother in labor, going as far as hurting it's handlers if they tried to stop the animals. The woman died during childbirth. The kid was something from the nightmares and scary stories: two curved horns, bright eyes without pupils, a long tail moving slowly and several pointed protrusions over its dark red, almost brown skin. The baby, covered in blood and happily chewing parts of the deceased mother is taken to the nearby forest and left alone by terrified midwifes, certain they have angered some vengeful Devil or Fey. An old Druid woman stumbles upon the baby while investigating the strange behavior shown by the wild animals and decides to raise the creature and gives it a human name, Sebastian Clearsky. The kid grows up mostly alone with his foster mother in the forest. He's able to hunt, though not reliably - some animals can't abide his presence, yet others just stand deathly still when he's nearby. He can light a fire and set up camp. He learns how to read the marks on the vegetation to know if there's a pack of Wolves hunting game or if there's a Will-o'Wisp bothering the pregnant bear nearby. He knows what plants will give him edible fruits and which branches are better to support a tent. He's not exactly attuned to the nature around him, but even though he struggles, he learns how to deal with the his reality. Strange things sometimes happen around hi: claw marks in tress that belong to no known animal or monster nearby, fog and hail appear for some minutes in the middle of summer and every once in a while bugs will appear in masses inside one of his footsteps. Humans he interacted with were either afraid or angry at him; people just assumed he was an evil being. His mother, Lorena Clearsky, never judged him for what he was, but she never judged him for what he did either. She believed that things were what they were and her job was to help nature balance itself - which was the natural flow when things just were what they were. The idea that Sebastian was something other than what he thought he was terrified him. He didn't want to be a mere spectator to his own life's fate. 'What if I'm evil, no matter what I try to do?' He didn't really strive to be a beacon of good of morality, he just wanted to be himself, not a puppet to gods, devils or ancient dragons. When he's a little over 14 he comes across a young woman guarding a merchant cart all by herself in a desert road. She's the first person not to be afraid of him and even start talking to the Tiefling and being pleasant. Her name is Clarissa, she's short, head filled with a blond wavy hair, fair skinned, with small tattoos around her green, round eyes that blend with her multiple freckles. She's just turned 18 and isn't lean nor chubby. They quickly turn into friends and meet each other every week to chat, exchange stories (she once helped his uncle deliver a beautiful jade crown to the nearby lord's daughter's birthday! She been to cities, she's seen elves and dragon bones and gnomish trinkets of all kinds!) and just enjoy each other company. After a few months he's completely charmed by her beauty and joy and sincerity and gracefulness. She invites him to an encounter under the full moon's light and, delighted, Sebastian drinks wine and dances with Clarissa until he passes out. He wakes up on his back, black roots chaining him to the ground inside a crudely drawn circle of weird symbols. His chest is bare and Clarissa towers over him, holding a twisted bright-red blade attached to a handle made of distorted yellow bone, pulsating like a living thing. Her green eyes are inhumanly pale and she's completely naked, tattoos covering her body from the neck to her knees. The tattoos move, scorpions, snakes, spiders and shadows woven into her skin moving swiftly, as if fighting for another inch. From her mouth come wrong sounds, like a serpent or stone crushing or ice snapping or fire melting skin and charring bone; still he understand that she's singing. She's singing, no, she's calling for something bigger and older than creation. As soon as she brings the knife to Sebastian's chest the pain makes the world goes dark; he touches the coldness of the void, he sees depths of the nine circles of hell, he feels the despair of every agonizing soul held away from their gods and penitence. He hears his name being Called, his fate being pushed and pulled around like a dead rabbit thrown to rabid dogs, something dark and powerful and hungry for his role to be fulfilled toys with his soul. He hears and feels and sees everything yet he refuses to let reality have its way. He does not pray, he does not wish, he wills his truth into reality and, for a fraction of a second, creation bends to him. One last image is ironed to his mind before everything goes dark: Clarissa, eyes wide with terror, holding the blade with both hands, all her tattoos gone and his own blood covering her arms up to the shoulders. Sebastian wakes up in the morning alone, shirtless under the cold drizzle. All around him there are crumpled roots and dead things. The stench of rot and acid makes him gag. He feels his chest and finds a neatly healed scar, bright red, in the form of a small rune no bigger than his fist. He touches the weird rune and at once understand its meaning: [BANE]. The red dagger is on his left hand, deformed and half melted. The blade is dull, the bright red now faded to an almost rust like color. The yellow bone is shattered but somehow every piece is still in the correct position. It doesn't feel right to leave the dagger in the forest, so he tucks it away and looks around. He can't find any sign of Clarissa or the circle. If not for his scar he would believe it all to have been a strange dream. Strange nightmare, more likely. Sebastian goes back to his hut and finds it completely deserted. No sign of anyone ever living there, just an empty place. He stays there for 3 months, every day going back to the place he woke up and finding nothing different, except for himself. He could feel power, someone's power, his power running inside him. Every day, before leaving the hut, he'd find a rune written somehow. Once it was a swarm of insects that moved together to form the symbol, once the rune in a dead goat's insides. One day it was clawed in every tree around his hut. Blood and feces on the ground; formed by the tangled antlers of a two rotten deers, locked in battle; appeared on patterns on the back of a dead frog, half eaten by the skeleton of a spider. Every day the same rune, the same idea would become clear in his mind as soon as he spotted the rune: [DISTANT CITY](It really depends on the game being run, the idea is that some outer power is prodding him to go to the city where the adventure will being) . He couldn't just accept that thing's order, whatever it was, but he couldn't deny Sebastian has hundreds of questions and no answer: Where was Lorena Clearsky? What happened to her? Who really was Clarissa? Did I somehow cause her to be possessed? Had she been trying to use me since the first day? Was she a good person - the only other person to treat me well - that suffered under some kind of otherwordly horror because of me? Was she a bad person all along that just saw me as an evil source of power? Where is she? What happened? Where is this power coming from? Who is trying to control me? Why [BANE]? Who is toying with my fate? No answers would be found here, there was only one way. Forward, always forward. Sebastian would move on, toward the city. He would grow strong to control his own fate and discover what happened to him."}]}

Her father abandoned Lemire’s mother, Daspira, when Lemire and her sister were small children. Although Daspira never told her children much of their father (other than that he was a rotten bastard who deserved eternal suffering in Baator), Lemire suspected that he was the fabled assassin Barlech, and that he abandoned his family for their own safety. For the first few years of her life, Lemire’s family subsisted on a regular delivery of a few coins, presumably from her father. After some time, these deliveries stopped and Daspira soon turned to prostitution to keep her children fed. Daspira was able to fetch a surprisingly large amount of coin selling her body, with many men coming to the slums to fulfill their violent fantasies of “taming a demon.” At the same time, she was subjected to much abuse, and would often come home bleeding and with bruises.    Daspira spent more and more time away from home, leaving Lemire to care for her young sister, named Gentle (Daspira had regretted not giving both her daughters “virtue” names, and often referred to Lemire as “Hope,” a name she rejected even as a small girl). When Lemire was twelve years old, she discovered her mother in a tavern purchasing black mold spores. Although Daspira denied that the drug was for her, for Lemire the last several months came into focus. Her mother’s erratic, inscrutable behavior and long spells away from home suddenly made sense in the context of dependency on the evil spores. The worry for her mother that Lemire had carried with her gave way to intense anger. She told Daspira not to bother coming home. Lemire would not see her again for four years.   Needing to fully provide for herself and her sister, Lemire took to picking pockets. She was a natural petty thief, and soon became an accomplished pickpocket, cutpurse, and burglar. Although the slums did not offer many lucrative opportunities, the young tiefling felt safe there. While her brick-red skin and budding horns made others mistrustful of her, she knew that the slum was far more accepting than the world at large, and here she did not need to work especially hard to hide her race. When she did venture from the slums, she took care to cover herself in a heavy cloak and scarves to hide her face. While the purses were much heavier in the city center, there was also greater risk of being caught, and Lemire knew that her race would do her no favors if she were put on trial--if she even survived that long. She had heard many tales of tieflings ran through in the streets by the Gold Cloaks and city guards who would leave the bodies in the street while laughing and heading to the tavern for a pint. Needless to say, she only left the slum when she and her sister were especially in need.  Lemire and Gentle lived this way for several years. Now old enough to take on some work of her own, Gentle found a job washing tankards at a grimy tavern. The tavern keeper was known for being kindly to tieflings, even when it hurt his business to do so. Many times he would open shop only to find TIEFLING LOVER and nasty epithets painted on his walls. No one knew why he took to tieflings, although Gentle had suspected he had once loved one. Though Lemire’s experience of the world was broader than Gentle’s, it was still rather limited; yet, Lemire felt she knew better than naïve young Gentle. No human man had ever loved a tiefling.   Over time, Lemire learned to target other criminals: other cutpurses at first, working her way up to robbers and spore dealers and illegal weapons traders and worse. She especially delighted in stealing from those working for Geth, an infamous human gangster known for being cunning and cruel in equal measures who had taken over most of the black market trade in the slums. She targeted Geth because she had once heard a rumor that Geth had trapped and killed Barlech in his quest to consolidate power. One day, she saw Geth himself perusing wares in the market. She couldn’t believe her eyes. He had three body guards with him, but they seemed to be paying more attention to the shopkeepers and street vendors than they were Geth. She was sure that she was skilled enough to get Geth’s purse, which was tied loosely to his belt.   She was wrong.  Geth’s guards knocked her unconscious and brought her to one of Geth’s many safe houses. When she came to, the crime lord—slender, tall, gesticulating wildly while he spoke—revealed that he had set a trap for the young tiefling. Suspecting that she had been targeting his men specifically, he decided to present her with an opportunity she could not resist. He was impressed by Lemire’s audacity and told her as much. He asked her why she had been targeting him, but she refused to answer. Even after several broken fingers, she still resisted. “Like father, like daughter, I see,” Geth said, all but outright confirming Lemire’s suspicions that the assassin Barlech had sired her. “Well then, let’s try a different route.” One of Geth’s goons brought forth Gentle, who was restrained at the wrists and ankles and paralyzed with fear. “If you come to work for me, your sister will never want for anything. Riches will be yours. You can even deliver your whore mother from her wretched work.”  Lemire, all the wrath of Nine Hells coursing through her, knew she had no other choice. Choking down her disgust and hurt, she agreed. Geth’s face twisted in a wicked smile. “Well, that was far too easy. Your father had much more fight in him.” He signaled to one of his guards who swiftly cut Gentle’s throat. Lemire screamed, kicking, trying to get away from the man who was holding her. Her tail lashed wildly. Geth’s gaze pierced her. “You’re a good thief, this much is true. But you flatter yourself if you think I have any need for a fucking tiefling daughter of a whore. You know, when I killed Barlech, it wasn’t just because he was a threat to me. I did the world a favor by ridding it of that demon spawn. You and your kind are abominations, girl.” Geth told her to leave town by next sunset. “And lest you think I will kill you if you don’t, a fate you’d probably welcome with open arms, know that what I have in mind for you is far, far worse than death.” Geth’s men blindfolded Lemire, knocked her unconscious, and dumped her in an alley.  When she awoke, she immediately sought out her mother. She wasn’t sure why. For comfort? To say good-bye? She found her in a decrepit inn near the seaport. She wasn’t easy to rouse, but when she came to, Lemire could tell that her mother already knew what had happened; perhaps she had even helped Geth set his trap, who could say? Lemire didn’t bother accusing her mother; in fact, no words were exchanged between them. Daspira, looking as though she had aged decades, barely able to walk, hobbled over to a chest of drawers. One drawer had a false bottom, and from this hidden chamber she produced a small golden key. In Lemire’s career as a cutpurse she’d seen many such keys; they were for the personal vaults at the central bank. Daspira pressed the key into Lemire’s hand, and looked at her daughter with a sadness that knew no end. The two embraced.  That night, Lemire painstakingly filed her horns and packed her few possessions, including a locket belonging to Gentle. She slept fitfully, and in the morning she dressed in her cloak and scarves. She knew she was being watched and did her best to evade Geth’s men. She suspected that they would not follow her into the city center, and she was right. At the central bank, she moved swiftly to the private vaults, her tail wrapped nervously around her left leg. She had expected to be stopped, asked to prove her business in the vaults, but no one so much as looked her way. She made her way to vault 406, the number imprinted in a tiny scrawl on her key, her good hand shaking as she inserted the key, the broken one hanging limply by her side. The lock clicked loudly as it unlatched. She looked over her shoulder. Still, no one was watching. She wondered if the key were perhaps imbued with some kind of magic. She opened the door and couldn’t believe what she saw before her: a silvery-blue needle the length of her arm, thin as spider-silk. She held it, turning it away from the light. She gasped as it seemed almost to disappear.  With the small amount of gold she had been saving, her sister’s locket, and her needle wrapped in a scarf, she stowed away in the belly of the caravel The Grey Griffon. Lying uncomfortable in the ship’s bowels, her  dark eyes narrowed. The burning hatred inside her gave her confidence and resolve. “I’ll be back for you, you bastard.” "}]}

He is a warforged rogue."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There was a medical student on the island of Novus. The third son of four in a middle class family, he didn't stand out. He got a partial scholarship for school, but it ran out and he was forced to search for an apprenticeship. The only arrangement he could get was more like indentured servitude. His new master separated him from his family and his few friends. The youth's curiosity and eagerness to make something of himself were all that sustained him. Early on, his studies continued almost as they had at university. Eventually, however, his master began to berate him for having only middling intellect and talent. His lessons became shorter and less frequent, and his days were filled with drudgery. His master took on other students, from wealthier families; smarter men and women who lived up to his strict expectations. They were allowed into the master's lab, when re he conducted secret research. Finally, when the student become servant had given up hope of being a doctor, the master invited him into the secret lab. Here, the master conducted experiments aimed at achieving takwiin, the creation of artificial life. Instead of being allowed to help conduct these experiments... The former student became a subject. With the help of advanced healing magic, he was kept alive and conscious as he was dissected and put back together, over and over, until the master believed he fully understood the mechanisms of life. Then, the subject was taken apart one final time. It took months, for the master went much slower this time. Each piece of the subject was removed, labeled, preserved, and used as a model to create an artificial replica. Then the new piece was attached. Piece by piece, the subject was disassembled and remade, aware the whole time. There are no words in any language, save perhaps infernal, to describe the pain. He begged every day, or at least every day that he had a mouth to beg, for the torment to end. The master was cold and unyielding in his amoral scientific fervor, but the other students left, one by one, and never returned. The doctor was left alone with his creation. Towards the end of the process, one other person did appear. The haze of pain masked their appearance and their words to the subject, but their purpose would become clear in hindsight. In fact, it would become nearly all-consuming. On the final day, the subject's pain faded, leaving him clear-headed and... Whole. Intact for the first time in what seemed like a century, but couldn't have been much more than a year. The master was there, looking at him, scrutinizing him with dispassionate eyes. The master said \"Your name is Victor, and you have been given a purpose. Kill the High Inquisitor. You have been created for this reason, and no other. You have been given the tools and skills you will need to accomplish this task, and no more. Your name is Victor, and you have been given a purpose. Kill...\" No more words reached Victor. Information flooded his brain. How to pick a lock. How to kill a man with a crossbow bolt from fifty paces. How to remain unseen. How to create deadly poisons. False memories also jostled for space inside his skull. They threatened to erase any remaining traces of that old, unfamiliar life that someone else had lived in another body. When Victor was again aware of his surroundings, the master was gone. The room was empty. Victor hesitantly stood, testing the leather, wood, and steel that now made up most of his body. He walked through an archway into the room beyond, and found a low bench with clothing and a pack on it, as well as weapons. To the side was a mirror that reached floor to ceiling. Victor stared. He saw a naked man, short and slim, with skin the color of well worn leather or waxed mahogany. A seam ran down his chest, starting at the base of his throat and ending at his navel, and inside he saw gears, shafts, dials, and wires. In the center of his chest, nestled among the machinery, glowed a red crystal shaped like a heart, with perfectly chiseled chambers and valves. Victor tore his eyes away, and quickly fastened the opening shut with implanted reflexes. He turned to the clothing and gear, and meticulously equipped himself. Then he left. A purpose burned in his heart: he was going to kill the High Inquisitor--it was what he was made to do. "}]}

I’ve been in the southern border guarding against orcs for the past few summers.  I’m not sure what they want, but it does require me to go into the village which I prefer not to do. -They are sending me on a mission.  I am going to be working with the Montinubris Military to protect our interests.  To this end I received a bag of holding and a few other items that may or may not be useful.  I also have a list of magical items to watch for and hopefully return with so the mages can study them further or try to duplicate them.  Forrest Storm said ”It’s time to stop hiding and find your own path.  There is a huge world out there waiting for you.   It’s time to find your answers there.” -I arrived in town today.  I met my contact and was told that I would be a consultant with the military group.  There is something going on on one of the outlaying plantations that they require assistance with.  Apparently they have loosed a nightmare creature of some sort that is wreaking havoc with the commoners. -We came to the plantation yesterday.  There is some sort of trial going on.  Some fighter beat the crap out of several guards and got caught.  Where and why was not mentioned. I’m going to try to find a place to work out before I go stir crazy.  This whole area is barren.  Oh, how I miss my forrest with huge trees and lively animals to talk to. I’m staying in the plantation house as there are not exactly alot of females and they have no place else to put me.   As if females are not twice the fighters males are! -I had a fairly good work out in the workout area.  The commoners must really be leary of fighters as the practice area is far outside of the main plantation area.  I was approached by Grok, one of the other fighters and he requested to spar with me.   We are fairly evenly matched so it was a good workout.  He did try to disarm me and got punched for his efforts though. -Today we rode out to a cave system that was recently opened and is believed to be the origin of the creature/s.  There is writing on the cave that I can’t quite make out other than sealed, Master of Shadows, and MARKELL.  I get the feeling that this place was sealed for a good reason and it was NOT supposed to be reopened.  2 rangers have disappeared w/i it’s depths already.  The very air reeks of evil near the entrance.  May the Goddess of the Woodlands protect me in this alien place. -We entered the cave late this morning.  It was dark and dank.  We followed Jumper, the halfling, as he is the trap expert.  We found the remnants of a bar that was apparently cursed.  It was almost stopped in time.  The remains of 3 cages were also found, torn apart from the inside out.  There was more writing on the walls that appeared the same as the wall outside.  I couldn’t make out anything else though.  The fighter Grok asked what I was reading and when I told him he dropped like a stone.  We took him back outside to help revive him.  After he woke up he told me of his strange dreams he’s been having.  They appear to be closely related to whatever is happening here.  The bodies of the missing rangers were found torn limb from limb in the back of the bar.  There was no blood anywhere.  I don’t know what type of creature did this, but it is undeniably evil. -By the time we roused Grok it was starting to get dark so we decided to continue our cave explorations in the morning.   Then the alarm went up from the main plantation in the distance.  The entire party rushed back and we found another victim behind the house.  It was obvious that whatever was in the cave had escaped.  I tracked it to the edge of shadows and the tracks just disappeared.  Then I heard the comment that ”It can’t just disappear, it must be in the ground”.   Next thing I knew the creature exploded up out of the earth.   It vaguely resembled a troll w/ metal of some  sort running thru it’s body.   I got the first shot in and hurt it.   Grok threw his weapon at it and missed the thing completely.  His weapon struck the party leader in the shoulder instead.  I hit the thing right in the privates and it went back into the earth.  The cleric said a spell and sank  his sword into the earth where it disappeared.  It came boiling out of the earth again and it looked like it had started to heal itself.  I got it again, immobilizing one hand and the halfling immobilized the other.  Someone else hit it and it howled and turned to ashes.  I hope this is the last I’ve seen of these creatures.  -Father Collins said that this is probably one of three creatures beleived to have escaped from the cave.   So we have at least 2 more to go. -When we went back to the house Bobbi went in the wrong door and got tripped over by a huge cook who was carrying a large, boiling hot pot of soup.  He was immediatly drenched with turnip soup.  He yelled and took off down the hall at a rapid rate.  Tolir was royally pissed and called the guards.  Bobbi bounced off the wall and went back the way he came.  He was snatched and held aloft by the guard.  Tolir’s daughter intervened for him and Tolir agreed not to harm Bobbi.  Bobbi was taken to the bunkhouse and the guards were told not to let him out again.   -I decided to try and find a library but was told the lord was particular about who went in there.  Instead I decided to wander in the hopes that I could locate another creature.  I located Grath and he agreed to accompany me.  We found Bobbi sneaking around outside and Grath started to haul him in but Bobbi offered him a Fairy drink and Grath forgot all about a possible bounty and joined him for a drink instead.  Then they turned around and followed me.  Bobbi  got a bright idea and decided to try and summon the creature.  The first time he was successful I got the creature in the hand, after which it sank back into the earth.  The second time it didn’t materialize enough for me to hurt it, but it began to hunt Bobbi. he ran for the bunkhouse and exploded out the back as it gave chase.   Bobbi did some sort of spell and grass started sprouting from the monster’s mound.  I noticed that the creature left a trail of coal black ashes, before it was changed to grass that is.  I may be able to track this thing after all.  Bobbi  decided to drop the cup he used for summoning and it was swallowed by the grass mound chasing him.  The mound then spread thru-out the field, I searched the area but I didn’t see anyplace where it led out of the field.  Father Collins couldn’t raise it again and Bobbi passed out from spellcasting.  I told the guards to post a perimeter guard and I climbed a nearby tree and got some sleep. -After breakfast Bobbi tried to raise it again, unsuccessfully.  I asked Father Collins to try to raise it and he was unsuccessful as well.  An hour or so later Bobbi  got one to drop from the sky, it was definately dead but I’m not sure if it was the same creature as before or not.   -Tolir gave me permission to go thru his library as long as I’m accompanied by a guard at all times.  He seemed rather surprised that I could read.  I don’t think he realizes that I’m a couple of centuries older than he is.  There wasn’t a whole lot of useful information there, but I did find a rather interesting book on land deeds and such for the local area though.  It seems that Tolir has managed to acquire most of the property around.  That reminded me of the note I got from Bobbi last night and I pulled it out.  According to that letter, Tolir is making treaties with his neighbors independent of the King, and not necessarily good for his health either.  I will definately be keeping my eyes open for further evidence though.  What I have now is just enough to get me hung.  I’m glad I’m writing this in slyvan!! -When I left the library I was just in time to join Jumper and Tolir on a return trip to the caves.  I noticed the stones around one of the cages is marked with the light symbol in draconic, apparently it was part of what was keeping one of the creatures caged.  The cages were of interesting construction though.  One was made of glass, one of metal and the last was made of stone.  The stone one is the one that is ringed by the stones.  I would deduce that they were specially made to contain the creatures that the mage was trying to create.  There is no way tell exactly how old they are but I would say very.  The metal is rusted and the stones of light were made by a high-level mage so could have been active for centuries at least.  The spell appears to be spent though, I wonder, do they only shine at night?  Could the sun’s presence be enough to contain that creature during the day, even underground?  What was finally strong enough to break the cages after so long a time?  Magic could have done it, after all there are spells to turn metal to rust and uncreate anything.  What mage around here is strong enough to overcome the original wards and why would they without firm control over the creatures released?  Were the creatures that escaped the originals or the offspring of the originals?  How does this tie into Tolir’s activities? Is he a mage or more likely, does he have one on his payroll?  I will have to make a point to come down here at night, as repellent as that thought is.  I can’t seem to make out anymore of the writing though.  It’s maddening, it looks like I should know it, but I can’t read it for anything!!  Grok started getting nervous and said he was ready to leave, cosidering what happened last time he came here I’m surprised he came back.  I really should find out if he’s dreamed anything else useful.  I decided to call it a early day and get some practice on the way back.  I’m going to try hunting these things at night tonight.  I’ll ask the rest of the guys who appear to be somewhat useful to come along as well.  Tolir’s not going to be one of them though.  His condescending attitude is starting to wear thin.  Especially considering I’m old enough to have bounced his GRANDFATHER on my knee!!! "}]}

Before he left, however, he took the time to learn all that he could about the natural world - what plants could be eaten, how to track animals, where to find necessities - as he had been fascinated with nature even more than the average wood elf ever since he first saw its raw beauty. Once he felt he had traveled far enough, he made that place his home. He maintained a roof above his head and fashioned a mat for meditation. He used his knowledge of various types of woods to craft a bow to protect himself from predators. Slow to use it, however, he has his fair share of scars, most notably on his chest where he has four parallel scars from where a bear attacked him. After fending off the beast, he ran for shelter lest he encounter more hostile creatures. As he was fleeing, he stumbled upon a pool which was home to a nymph who called herself Maia and, sensing that he cared about nature as much as she did, took him in and cared for him while he healed. He learned much from her about nature along with her language, Sylvan. When he fully recovered, he decided that it was time to leave. As he was alone and received little education, he knew very little about the world outside of nature and had nothing to his name aside from what he made himself. Chimara was happy for nearly 100 years, but slowly he began to yearn for something different. He wanted to do something other than survive. He decided that he wanted to appreciate nature the way it was intended to be enjoyed - with an adventure. He left his home at the age of 125 and headed for civilization. It was there that he first heard about the druids and the power they wield. He sought out a teacher and began to learn the ways of the druids. "}]}

Sometimes trading with the city when nature could not provide. All children of the tribe are taught the ways of nature and magic. Kvothe's first couple of decades were full of learning the ways of the druids. It can be lonely for a children in the tribe as elves don't have children as often as their human counter parts. From a young age Kvothe showed a very keen interest in nature and animals, however he did not seem to pay much heed to the other members of the tribe. As soon as he was able to walk he would wander off into the woods for hours and when asked where he had been he would always say “with his friends”.      Kvothe showed an incredible aptitude towards the wild shape and communing with nature, however he showed very little interest in elemental magic or some of the higher rituals of the tribe. When he reached the age of maturity he was to be put through the tribes coming of age test to prove that he would be a valued member of the tribe. The test consisted of the tribe member being sent out into the woods for a month to survive and better learn the ways of the wild it was not unheard of for children to never come back alive. That was no such issue for Kvothe after the first week he found that he preferred the woods to tribe life and at the end of the month when it was time for him to return he decided he did not want to go back.      After he had made his decision, he left the tribes normal paths and went deeper and farther away from the city than his tribe ever ventured.

Aria is an elven druid."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Aria had always been a bit of a loner, but that didn’t make it easier. Perhaps that’s why she felt sorry for the baby owl that laid at her feet. It had tried to fly too soon, or fallen from its nest, and had hurt its wing in the process. Too much too soon. How very familiar. Aria was a wood elf from a small tribe, not that she remembered much about her upbringing. Aria had gotten separated from her family when she was small. It had only been fifty years ago, at the beginning of the Laconian Expansion wars. She had been a child by elven standards, and still was to some degree. She was nearing the turn of her first century, a landmark occasion that would normally be celebrated by the whole tribe. She scooped up the baby owl. Maybe they could make a new tribe.  The Expansion wars had not been particularly brutal on the Wood Elves, they had quickly brought an end to the war once they became involved. Yet the initial Laconian assault had taken the elves off-guard. The villages closest to the border were hit hard. Aria was in one of those villages. She remembered the fires, licking high above the tree tops. A scout returned, saying that the humans had come and it was time to retreat deeper into the forest. Aria now knew the wisdom of this, they would retreat and regroup with a larger force in order to take the attack back to the humans. In the moment, she hadn’t even stopped to think. Aria grabbed her bow and rushed through the flames. She was young, but had always been talented surely she could handle what the others were too afraid to fight. There were multiple bands of human skirmishers, about a hundred soldiers in all. They were probably scouting out any Wood elf defenses, not that her people ever maintained defenses in peacetime. Aria loosed arrow after arrow into the soldiers, her face twisted in pain. She was filled with so much rage, that they would come into her home and cause such wanton destruction. She reached back for another arrow but her quiver was empty. Only then did she see the already cold faces of those she’d slain, and the horde of men rushing at her. She retched. Then she ran. She ran fast, faster than her pursuers, faster than the flames. Like a leaf on a winter wind, flying furiously to no where in particular but always away. When night finally fell she stopped, tears streaming from her eyes as she panted. That was a hard night, but she woke with clear eyes. She made arrows, got some food and set about making her camp livable. She spent a few months simply surviving in her little patch of woods, away from the war. She built a simple hut and lived a simple life. One day while Aria was smoking a rabbit, three Wood Elves appeared at the edge of her copse. They had smelled her cooking and came to investigate. Aria had never seen Wood Elves in armor, but these were wearing a livery that made them look like the most elegant soldiers she could have imagined. She of course invited them to share the rabbit, which they happily accepted. The soldiers told her that they were captains moving to the front lines, having been sent by the King in the Wood to oversee a few important battles. Aria perked up at this. She had put the war out of her mind after that first night, but she still felt like she should help her people. And who better to escort her to the front lines than these dashing elf captains? Aria gave them a quick rundown of her story, at which several eyebrows were raised, and asked to journey with them to where the fighting was. The captains had evidently heard of some fey elf maid whom was the first elf to slay a human in the conflict and were quite delighted to make her acquaintance. With enthusiasm they agreed to accompany her south.  In the following two years Aria distinguished herself among the elves and struck fear into the hearts of many Laconians. Her arrows flew like winged death and she was fair with a blade as well. During the years of the war, and in the years since, Aria had inquired everywhere about her tribe. No one had heard of the Coopers and didn’t know where they could be found. Everyone knew the border tribes had faired poorly in the first assault on the Great Wood. At the close of the war Aria went back to where it all started. She waited for weeks in the spot she had grown up. The old forest was gone. Meadow grass now pushed through the ashes. No one ever came back. Aria went back to her little hut in the woods, which was now quite dilapidated. There, near the buckling entrance, she had found the little owl. It didn’t take long for her to fix his wing and it didn’t take long for him to cozy up to her. She would call him Artemis and they would live in this patch of forest. Maybe she could build a treehouse so he would feel at home. Here they could have a simple life. She could harvest and hunt…maybe even take the odd mercenary job. They could have a simple life, punctuated with adventure. They could make a new family. "}]}

His keen grey eyes scan the horizon as he strokes his long brown beard. Several glowing blue fibers, enchanted to pulse in-tune with his mood, are woven through the braided facial hair. The light glints off the polished green stone, carved in the shape of an eel eating its own tail, that hangs from a leather cord around the dwarf’s neck. The dwarf stinks of seaweed, and his smile is always a moment away from turning to an dark, unnerving leer. This is Gabbro Eelstooth, a dwarf hunted by his own people--with good reason.  On board the Erasmus, Gabbro is always looking for something. Every spout of a distant leviathan or strangely-shaped piece of driftwood gives him momentary hope that he’s found some trace—any trace—of the wreck of the Serpentine. He knows that from the surface, such clues would be impossibly unlikely, but that hasn’t stopped him from looking.  Until recently, Gabbro was a sailor on the Bloodstone, a submarine pirate ship crewed almost entirely by his clanmates. All ships were fair game for this gang of pirates: gnoll ships they sank could be cashed in for bounties, while elven vessels were usually loaded with precious metals and bizarre magical artifacts to sell. But after decades of piracy, the captain on the Bloodstone became obsessed with a legend: the rumored sunken treasure of the Serpentine. The Serpentine, the legends said, was a merchant vessel travelling between the Dwarven seamounts and the cities of the elves. On its last voyage, it was laden with gifts for the elves—as well as a great Dwarven mechanic and his most prized inventions: compasses which resisted confounding magical effects, goggles which let the wearer see through the thickest fog, astronomical clocks which tracked the movements of the heavens and the other planes, automatons which could see and think for themselves, and more—and all without any magic at all. But the ship was sunk, though the legends vary as to why. Whoever claimed those ruins would be absolved of all crimes by any Dwarven government, and lauded as heros.  After three years of searching based only on hearsay, the crew grew weary. Their supplies were running low and the Bloodstone badly needed some time in dry dock. After a dive in which the captain refused to surface for air for so long that a cabin-boy died of suffocation, the crew mutinied. The gun-battle on board pierced the hull of the Bloodstone in several places. The ship was several hundred feet deep at the time, and as water poured in and the hull groaned under the strain, the mutineers claimed all the lifeboats, leaving the captain to be drowned and crushed at the bottom of the sea.  The lifeboats clung together at first, bobbing on the surface like a raft of sea otters. But the crew grew quarrelsome, each claiming that if he had been in charge, they’d have found the treasure months ago. The arguments grew and grew until the raft broke apart and scattered, the dwarves still screaming at each other that by the Gods, they’d find the treasure first!  Gabbro’s boat washed ashore at a small island port, where he spent a week wandering from inn to inn, drinking away what little money he had on him and thinking hard about what to do. None of the crew were the bookish types, Gabbro reasoned—if he could find a map, or even a scholar who knew the location of a map, he could go on a lot less than tall tales told in taverns. So he booked passage for the great city of Thasym, hoping to find some clue to work from.  Gabbro emits an air of ill repute; he’s a self-serving bully even at the best of times. But without a crew to back him up, he’d never openly admit he was a pirate unless he felt it benefited him—nor would he reveal his mission, for fear that somebody else would get to any map before he did. If asked about his past (including by Captain Mantor) he weaves a sob story about how his fishing ship was attacked and sunk by goblins, and he’s going to Thasym to petition his rich uncle for a loan to buy a new one.   Gabbro is driven to find this treasure—but not so driven that he won’t jump at an opportunity for more short-term profit first. If two years of searching didn’t find the Serpentine, he reasons, another month or two of delay won’t let his former crewmates get too big of an advantage. And the more money he has when he starts the search in earnest, the better a ship he can charter or purchase. Still, he is wary of delaying too long: rumor has reached him that others from his clan--not just the pirates--have put a bounty on his head. He's not entirely sure why... but whatever the reason is, it's probably justified.  The Eelstooth clan, from which many pirates and thieves are derived, uses the bioluminescent beard-decorations as its signature adornment. As such, they’re often known derogatorily as “glowbeards.” Unless it’s an obvious mistake, and possibly even then, Gabbro will attempt to outright murder anyone who calls him that. "}]}

She is a human bard."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cassandra was born, under another name, to a family of moderate spirits and low ambitions. For eight generations, they owned the same farm. And from generation to generation, the ownership passed the same way—father to eldest son. Cassandra was born the eldest son of the family, and for years, was told she would inherit the farm when she grew older and took a wife. Despite ambitions loftier than anyone in the previous eight generations, she put her back into the work, and dedicated herself to making her father proud. Undeniably, he was. She had a knack for her work in the field, and seemed, by all accounts, well-suited to it. However, she never felt any particular passion in the work, nor fondness for her father. By the age of eight, she had learned, rather, that she found more joy in shared activities with her mother. She would help with the housework whenever she could, as exhausted from the fields as she was. Her mother found this trait endearing. Her father, not so much. She, herself, couldn’t fathom what compelled her to the tasks until, at the age of eleven, she was separated from her father during a trip into the market, and found herself in an unfamiliar part of town, where she was greeted by a woman she didn’t recognize. In a masculine voice, the woman asked Cassandra, “Are you lost?”. She could only nervously stutter out a yes, and after a bit of calming down, the woman introduced herself as Elise. Cassandra, with childish curiousity, asked if she was a man or a woman, and Elise gave only a chuckle, and a short explanation, that she had been born a man, but came to see herself otherwise as she grew. When Elise eventually found Cassandra’s father and returned her, he didn’t give a thanks, but only a curt harrumph as he lead Cassandra away. But the memory of Elise stuck in her head long after, and by the end of the month, she couldn’t keep her thoughts to herself any longer. When she told her mom, she simply froze up and said to talk to dad. The very next day, while working in the field, she jammed her hoe in the ground, leaned on it to catch a breath, and spoke, spilling everything to him. What she had learned from Elise, the pain she’d been feeling, how she believed she was like the woman she met. Her dad only scoffed, and spoke down to her, ending the conversation with only, “You’ve got a pair of balls, boy. You’re a man, plain and simple. Don’t try and get out of a man’s work.” From then on, she was no longer allowed to do housework, and would be doubling down on work in the field, to ensure that she doesn’t “forget herself”. Any time she raised a fuss, her father reminded her of that same lesson as the first day. This treatment continued until she was 13, at which point she could stand it no longer.  Furious and dysphoric, she sneaked out her window late one night, and to the stable, where she found the surgical tools for the horses. Under the cover of darkness, she stuffed a rolled-up tunic between her teeth, and got to work, barely controlling her screams as she worked. It took nearly an hour, and by the end, she was bleary with blood loss, but at long last, it was done. Her testes, which had caused her so much sorrow for so long, were finally gone, and at last, she could be who she knew she was all along. At last, her father could accept her. However, when he found the bloodied tools, his reaction was nothing like what she had hoped. She explained herself—that she didn’t have balls anymore, that she could be a woman now. But instead of acceptance, he was furious at her. She could no longer inherit the farm. No longer have sons to help in the fields. Before the crack of dawn, he drove her out, away from the farm, and into the nearby woods. Mutilated, still recovering from her impromptu surgery, and broken with sorrow, it was in these woods that, when exposure and the animals would not take her life, she considered doing it herself. But rather, she survived. She found the road. Followed it to the large market town she remembered from her childhood. In the evening, she reached the gates, and by nightfall, she had got herself a humble meal with her small sum of silver she had stolen before she was driven away, and found a gutter to rest in. At first, she wept. Her life was over. There was nothing left for her. The destiny laid out for her had been quashed. The person she wished to be would never come to fruition. It was all too much for her. She wept, and wept, and wept, until she could take weeping no more, and instead chose to sing her lamenting. She sang the songs she remembered from the field, first quietly, then louder, and louder, and louder still, through her tears, until she had become so utterly enraptured by her own voice that she barely even noticed when a wealthy traveller tossed a gold coin at her feet. A gold coin, she thought, her eyes fixating on the sparkle of the metal. This was a greater sum than she had ever possessed for herself. With this alone, she could get herself a room for the night, somewhere warm, a hot meal in the morning. A few more, and maybe she could even get herself clothes to look like one of those wealthy merchants herself. Perhaps, she would get herself a nice dress to wear. That would do nicely, she thought, as she sang all through the evening, until there were no more common folk walking the streets, and with the moderate sum of copper, silver, and gold she had earned, slept comfortably for the night.  Days passed, and she became ever more fascinated with the way her voice had changed since her self-inflicted surgery. It was sweeter. Gentler. Less resonant, but more touching. She practiced with it day in and day out, sharpening it like a blade, performing until her throat was as dry as a desert, and then spending the money on drinks to quench her thirst so she could continue. As her income grew, she was able to spend it on more extravagant clothing, more dazzling makeup, until she was no longer known as “the boy in a dress”, and rather, as “The Golden Voice on Smith Street”. Day in, day out, she sang. As the shops closed for the evening, she would begin to draw a crowd, and it wasn’t long before the inn she was staying at began offering her gigs as an entertainer in exchange for a free room and meals.   Two years passed, and life grew easier for her. So much so that it had almost grown boring. The city life did not amuse her. It only sustained her. She met many people, some like herself, others not so much. Yet despite being an entertainer, she never felt that she, herself, was entertained. She yearned for excitement. For adventure. Fortunately for her, it was coming to find her. One of very few times she had her gig at the inn cancelled, she learned it was because of a minstrel group coming in, one which, supposedly, the innkeeper was especially fond of. They called themselves the World’s Widows, and were a group of musicians who wrote songs about a subject that most wouldn’t dare breathe a word about: heroic women. Intrigued, Cassandra sat in for the performance, knowing she had more than enough coin saved to survive a night off. The World’s Widows sang well through the evening, about tales of ladies dressing as men to go into battle, of women carrying their children out of disasters, then going back in to save others, standing up for their beliefs even in the face of tribulation or execution. She was intrigued with every single story. All around her though, the patrons seemed enraptured by the music, but utterly indifferent to the content. That is, until they began their last act, a song about a woman general who lead her men into victory. At this, some in the tavern began to boo, and demand that they stop the song and get off the stage. Still, they sang, even as it looked as though the crowd would rush the stage. In a moment of pure spontaneity, Cassandra stood up, and in her most powerful voice, joined in the chorus with the World’s Widows. As her voice echoed in the hall, those in audience were soothed, in awe, and sat back down, allowing the performance to continue, only to eventually cheer. After the show, the World’s Widows caught up with her, and she was invited to join them. After many fond farewells, and reminders from the barkeep that she could return if she so desired, she finally accepted their offer. The very next morning, they departed, and she began her life as a travelling minstrel. Among the World’s Widows, there were no rulers, and rather, matters were typically voted upon or debated, but the majority of time was spent travelling, drinking, and writing music. In every town they passed through, they would seek out women of great deeds to write their songs about. A favourite, for them, was of tales of ladies who disguised themselves as knights to go into battle. Cassandra shared this sentiment about such stories, and never tired of hearing them retold. But what she had not expected was that, not only did the minstrels tell the tales of heroic women. They lived them, as well. Through the World’s Widows, she was trained with blades and bows alike, taught to defend herself on the road. Taught to harness her voice into a potent form of magic. And with them, she felt as though she could rule the world.  She quickly found a place for herself among the World’s Widows, relating to their many stories. When asked about her past, she had already formed a perfect story—not a lie, but not the whole truth either: her father, not wanting a daughter, drove her off the farm, and she’d been living on the streets since, surviving by virtue of her voice. The rest of the minstrels took quickly to her, with the exception of one Theresa, a specialist in the lute, who was not so easily swayed. Within the group, they became somewhat of a pair of rivals, with Cassandra’s swelling pride causing competition and contention between them. At 14, Cassandra was the youngest member of the group, and the honour of having been accepted had gone heavily to her head, causing her to frequently egg Theresa on. The rivalry persisted, and though, in many cases, it only served to intensify their shared passion for the work, it only took a year for the arrangement to finally come to a head. In the midst of a high-profile performance, Theresa began her lute solo. Cassandra, however, cut the solo off early to begin singing again. As a result, Theresa began to play more loudly to try and drown her out. This exchange of one-upmanship continued throughout the performance until they broke into a full-on physical fight and the whole group had to be dragged out of the bar. It was that night that the World’s Widows agreed the two of them would have to settle their differences before either could be allowed on stage again. It was also that night when, after the performance, Cassandra was changing in her room, and Theresa came in unexpectedly. Seeing Cassandra naked, Theresa accused her of being a man pretending to be a woman. Before Cassandra could explain, Theresa ran off to the others and told them everything. By a majority vote, Cassandra was cast out of the World’s Widows, and left to fend for herself. In desperation, she returned to the inn where she had first begun performing, only to find her spot taken by another singer, and be unrecognized by the bartender. Having lost the spirit to try and go in and prove herself again, Cassandra moved on, drifting from city to city, singing her sorrows in the streets to get her meals, hoping against hope that she would one day get an opportunity to reclaim her honour. As she wandered, she practiced. She honed her skills with the bow. She wove her voice into more and more potent magicks. And she prepared herself for danger, with the styles taught to her by the World’s Widows. Years of folk heroism prepared her for the moment when she received her summons to Navrim, to fight on behalf of the lords of the realm. And so, she set off, in hopes of becoming a hero worthy of the songs of the World’s Widows, to take her place among legends. "}]}

He was expected to study in many fields of knowledge, and while he was competent at fighting, he was far more interested in craftmanship and history. He became obsessed with old songs about his ancestors, the magic they wielded, and the adventures they went on. He started studying music and magic as much as he could, but his royal duties kept him from it. One day, his father asked him to lead an attack force against a group of orcs that had infested one of their deeper gem mines. It was nearly a failure, and the only reason the orcs were removed from the mine was the result of Trakul's father taking over at the last minute. Trakul was stripped of his royal title and cast out in disgrace, so he took the opportunity to study music and magic further. He made his way out of the mountains to a deep forest, where he came across a clan of elves. They initially wanted to reject him, but their royal bard took pity on Trakul and took him in. He trained with the royal bard for years, perfecting his craft by learning the lyre, learning musical spells, and ancient songs and tales of adventure. He also learned how to be a damn good entertainer as well. When Trakul left, his mentor gave him a magic lyre, a book of spells, and a word of advice: \"Be friendly to everyone, but trust no one.\" Trakul made a living as a traveling musician for a few years, but yearned to learn more songs. However, he could not find any, so he decided to write some of his own. For inspiration, he traveled with a group of adventurers and wrote songs about their exploits. He had to do a fair bit of adventuring himself, though, and he quickly acquired a taste for death-defying treasure hunts. So, as well as being a musician, he became an adventure-seeker as well."}]}

Reh Ince... Und Oh bey~    “That’s a weird song yer singin’ miss.” “It is nothing but an old childhood song from my home.”    “Sounds kinda sad fer a children’s tune dontcha think?” “The only thing making this song sad is your perception.”    “Whatchu on about? Yer the one dats singin’ it ain’t ye?”    I pause. Thinking about my home, my family, and my sister. “Then again maybe the one making it sad is me.” I admit.    I smile, remembering a silly phrase my sister use to say to me so long ago.      ——————————  It’s been about two years since I decided to leave Sapona. My sister, Loryal, and I were part of the royal family. From an outsiders perspective we look like the perfect family, however behind the castle walls was nothing but anger and sadness. When we weren’t outside our parents bombarded us with lessons, grooming us to be the perfect brides. When they weren’t teaching us my parents would constantly argue over which one of us would marry which noble in some other kingdom. It was frustrating... For our parents to only see us as objects for trade, as currency... It was saddening. “I don’t think they see us like that.” My sister would say, reassuringly. Then she would smile    “Maybe it’s just you.”    “Yeah maybe it’s me.” I would say halfheartedly.  —————————— Despite all that the lessons took its toll on us, and we coped with it in our own ways. My sister decided to dabble in thievery. Whenever she could she would sneak out and try to scale walls,   pickpocket the guards, or train with swords and bows in the barracks. Me, on the other hand,  spent most of my free time in the royal library. Reading about heroes from faraway places, their adventures and endeavours, invigorated me. It sparks something in my soul. They were so different from me. Free from some pre-determined destiny laid out before them. Free from the confines of castle walls. These heroes... they were people! They were viewed as people and heroes. Unlike me, only seen as a princess or some trade goods. I also loved to sing. At first I’d sing just classic children's songs an poetry. Singing helped me forget about the world around me, and allowed me to just focus on myself, an my voice. It was rejuvenating. Eventually my two passions combined and I was singing about the heroes whom I adored. One night my sister arrived home really late. She climbs in through our bedroom window, covered in dirt and scratches. In her hands was an object about arms length covered by a brown cloth. “I got you a mandolin!” she exclaimed. “Since you love singing, and because you don’t need no man.” I laughed, and she smiled that infectious smile. As she unveiled the instrument I was astonished. The woodwork looked amazingly well done. The gold trimming around it depicted a unique and beautiful floral design that seemed to breathe under the full moonlight. On one side of the front it said my name, on the other it said hers. In my hands the mandolin felt perfect, like it belonged in my grasp. “I love it, thank you!” I hugged her tightly. As I tried out the mandolin I looked at my sister and asked her. “Don’t you want to sing with me?” “No, no, singing is just your thing!” She smiled. “Yeah... maybe it’s just mine.” I’d say.  ————————————— One day my parents told me that they have finally decided on a suitor for me to marry. Some weird noble in a far far away land, whose main exports is donkey. The Hrek family. I couldn’t stand it, I didn’t want this. I wanted to make my own story, just like the heroes from so long ago that I’ve read about. So I left it all behind. Late at night as I was leaving the castle my sister grabbed my hand. “Don’t leave!” she pleaded. “I have to! There’s no way I’m going to marry that Hrek Noble!” “But where would you go!? What would you do!?” “Does it even matter? Maybe I’ll sing, maybe I’ll write, maybe I’ll die. Anything is better than this!” I turned to face her. “There has to be more than my story than this! Don’t you ever think about life beyond these walls!? beyond marriage?!” “I... No I guess I haven’t really thought about it that much.” She admitted, letting go of my hand. She then looked at my, teary eyed, and smiled. “Maybe it’s just you.” She said, her voice almost breaking. “Yeah maybe it’s just me.” I said confidently. —————————————————— In the past two years I travelled most of the world. I’ve seen people who used ice as weapons, a half-man half donkey hellbent on finding a gunman, a gunman hellbent on killing donkeys, a grand library controlled by magic, and so much more. Getting by through my knowledge and voice. All this time I’ve been searching for my story, for my purpose. And now I’m here, on a boat with a man named Oboe, sailing towards some weir city named Bolobin. “Hey miss, we’ve been sailing fer a couple o’days now”  “Indeed.” “You never told meh yer name y’know.” “It’s May.” I said “May Bell” “Weird name...” Oboe said. I looked down on my mandolin. Despite the use it never seem to wear down. The gold trimmings still shimmered underneath the sun. I ran my fingers on it’s front, feeling for the names. On one side said my sisters name: Loryal. As I reached for the other side, feeling for my old name I whispered the saying my sister would say long ago. “Maybe it’s Maybeline.” "}]}

Just a red glow illuminating the horizon where it would have been. That morning it had been his village, as the day went on it became a growing column of smoke rising behind him, and as night set in the smoke faded into the darkening sky and was replaced with The red glow.   Dima closed his eyes to get his bearings.   The raiding party arrived a couple hours after sunrise. Disguised as drift raiders coming from the dunes their armor betrayed them as a professional army. No desert raiders would fight in anything that bulky. These were coasters who had probably never set foot in the desert before.  Not that it mattered.   Arath was a small village, maybe a couple dozen people of fighting age, and none of them real fighters. It was over before it really began. They grabbed whatever fighting implements they could find - Dima had always been good with his hunting knives - but were quickly routed by the professional soldiers.  Dima's father fell in the fighting. Sharaia, his sister, had just, disappeared. One minute she was standing with Dima, loosing arrows into the attackers, he next she was just, gone. Dima had fled moments later with a small bag of supplies.   The sun was below the horizon now, so that must have been 10, maybe 12 hours ago. He had run a short distance, maybe a couple kilometers, before slowing to a walk. Running in the desert was a good way to end up dead. He had walked the rest of the day. The drift wasn't easy terrain, but it was his home, so he figured another 20 kilometers was reasonable (that would explain the fires being over the horizon). At least enough distance that nobody was likely to find him.   He considered his next move. North, further into the drift. Harsh travel, but a coaster army would never venture that far into he desert, and he could hook up with a drifter community. South, back toward Arath. The raiders had likely rejoined the main army, so it was safe, but to what end? Find his sister? Even a master fracker wouldn't find her if she didn't want to be found, and Dima was far from a master. Plus, as much as he liked to think he would protect her, she was far more capable on her own than he was. East, to the grand capital. He could warn them, but surely their scouts already knew, and what use would one he be there. West, to the Spire mountains. He could follow the river, and the travel would be easy, but that's the most likely supply line for the invaders, and he wasn't eager to cross them again.   Dima opened his eyes.   "}]}

He never had any siblings and when he was 8 years old both his parents died when an invading nation attacked their town.

He knew there was purpose to their protection, even if he didn't know what that purpose was, and being among the ruins he swore he could still feel the presence of his family. He felt comfortable and safe there and he knew his family would want him to be there.  Abandoning the civilized world at such a young age to guard these ruins, Finnan grew very close to nature and would often meditate and commune with the spirits of the surrounding woods. One day while in this meditation, Finnan noticed an elvish figure tracking and hunting a large brown bear. Recognizing the bear as the recent mother of 3 cubs Finnan ran and leapt in front of the hunter's arrow to protect the bear shouting \"You mustn't kill her! She has cubs!\", being shot in place of the creature. Startled, the hunter rushed to Finnan's aid but it was too late and the arrow had struck right through his heart.  Sylvanus, God of Wild Nature, came to Finnan in death and told him that he had given his life for a noble cause but being the last living protector of Graythorn he could not die just yet. Sylvanus then told Finnan that he would revive him for a cost that he would one day need to pay, but not to worry for as long as he stood protector of Graythorn he would not need to pay this debt. Finnan accepted and was revived, still laying in the hunter's arms. Finnan spent the next few days healing and getting to know the hunter, spilling his life story with the first person he had seen in the 12 years since his family had died. The hunter was actually a huntress. A short athletic Drow named Zar'rae who too lived just outside these woods nearly 80 years, raised by her adopted Wood Elf family.  During the few days spent healing Finnan's physical features began to slowly shift from human to almost demonic. His light hair grew even lighter until it was pure white. His pale skin grew darker and more red in color. His brow slowly lost all hair and merged to form a set of 4 small toothlike horns. His teeth sharpened almost vampirically, the front teeth growing in length as well. And a thin tail with a pointed spade shaped tip poked it's way through his pants. Seeing this transformation from a paleskinned Human to a redskinned Tiefling, Zar'rae knew all too well from her being a Drow, how ever good Finnan may be, if he ever were to rejoin society now he would surely be discriminated against. Zar'rae began to take pity on him and offered her friendship to Finnan, visiting him daily at the ruins.  Naturally, as time passed Zar'rae had finally grown old enough in her family's eyes to set off and travel the rest of the world, and so she did, and Finnan became alone once again.

Mav was a child when he arrived with his merchant parents in Saerloon. His family was of some considerable wealth, at least enough to afford the tutelage of the displaced Rasheman witch Ivani. When he was six years old, his parents left him in Ivani’s care as they departed for a trademeet. They never returned. To this day, Mav doesn’t know what happened to them. Luckily, they left Ivani a fine inheritance so she could take him in as an apprentice. Mav’ren was a capable, if difficult, apprentice. While he understood the theory behind magic, he had difficulty grasping at the threads of power. Because of this, Ivani crafted for him a special focus: A ring and bracelet fashioned of copper wire. Within each is a tiny needle, enough to prick the skin and draw blood, closing a circuit of energy that allows Mav to manipulate the forces needed for any spell. Ivani was a good mentor, taking care of Mav’ren for three years. One day, she left with what Mav could only describe as a band of men. She left with some urgency, gathering her spellbook and whatever she could cram into a backpack. None of them ever came back. To this day, Mav doesn’t know what happened to them, or why they left. If Ivani had a journal, she took it with her. or seven months, Mav’ren took care of himself. He knew all the passwords to the wards, where all the gold was kept, where all the good books and reagents were stored. It sucked not having Ivani around, but Mav could take care of the place (as was part of his apprenticeship). That changed when Cranmer broke into the place. It was clear that Cranmer had no business being there, but being a thief, a wizard’s manse that had been empty for over half a year was up for exploration – at least, before the other gangs barged in. But seeing Mav on his own… well… Cranmer wasn’t about to leave the boy on his own, so he made an offer. Mav’ren took about five minutes to come to a decision. Cranmer’s Guild, the Crows, had the most unique weapon amongst the gangs of Thieves in Saerloon: diplomacy. They established the boundaries of the various Guilds, cobbled alliances, and helped keep the peace in the city – and all profited from it. Cranmer led his crew through respect, both given and received. It was here the Mav’ren’s talents came to light. As he lived amongst his guildmates, Mav continued his studies. In the process, he also understood how criminal activity worked. Five years after he joined the Crows, Mav became aware of the activity of a freelancer disrupting the peace. Cranmer put Mav to use, letting him establish the pattern of activity, the mode of operations, and other patterns that brought the rogue to the Guilds’ own justice. Mav continued this line of work for years, helping the keep freelancers in line and the Guilds accountable. The Crows were small but efficient and profitable. One Crow, Thalia, took an interest in Mav, helping him “become a man.” It was a mutual arrangement given she became a woman. Despite the nature of thieves, the two became a loving pair. Six months ago, Mav needed to travel to Selgaunt for a particular tome he needed. When he returned, his guild house was empty. No sign of forced entry, no sign of battle, no sign of treasure. Despite this, Mav found several trinkets left behind that he knew no Crow would abandon. In his lover’s room he found the silver locket he gave her, his lock of hair still inside. Given all the signs, Mav knew he had one course of action: get the hell out of the city. He burned the hair in the locket and departed Saerloon, looking for numbers to keep him safe. To this day, he doesn’t know what happened to the Crows, but whatever pattern’s been established, he intends to decipher it… and break it. "}]}

Jinroth taught him his craft over several long years. He was not, however, alone in this - his master had another apprentice, a half-elf by the name of Elqarim. Elqarim was the son of a noble, and Kalkheus always secretly assumed that he had bought his way into his master's workshop. Kalkheus was never a man of means, so there was always a disconnect between them, stemming both from Kalkheus 's jealousy and Elqarim's haughtiness. Elqarim would always act superior to Kalkheus, and was always one-upping him, much to Kalkheus 's chagrin. While Jinroth liked to think he treated both apprentices equally, he always seemed to work Kalkheus harder, and his criticism was harsher even when it wasn't nearly as deserving as Elqarim. Mostly, Jinroth was scared of any repurcussions from Elqarim's family, as they were very influential. Eventually, both apprentices were skilled enough to be recognised as proper artificers. Finally, their invention contests would come to an end...or so Kalkheus thought.  Afterwards, Kalkheus received no immediate work and so furthered his studies for a year. Eventually, Kalkheus spent many years as a sailor on a ship, travelling the coast from port to port. He worked under Captain Orvelle Fogwatcher, a female human. The long days at sea gave him ample time to tinker on and off, and the hard work kept him physically fit. His inventions occasionally helped operation of the ship, which earned him favor with his captain and crew, whose work was made marginally easier. Any engineering problems on the ship were also his domain. His reason for the life of the sea was to discover artefacts. Sailors traverse great destinations across the land, and port cities are fountains of information.   Unfortunately, his old apprentice rival had his money in more pockets than even the trade winds could reach, and every opportunity Kalkheus discovered was a bust - for him. Elqarim was once again one-upping Kalkheus, this time with his magical discoveries.  Determined to show his nemesis up, Kalkheus decided he needed to do away with his familiar sailor life and get his hands dirty if he was going to harness unknown magic and powerful objects to expand his craft, receive recognition and unravel mysteries known to no others. He left the ship behind, much to the disappointment of the crew. He had grown rather close to them, especially his captain and while there was regret in leaving, he knew his desire to discover and his pride would not let him stay."}]}

Among the dead was Elaine and Tristan still wearing the jewellery Lillian once made them.  The town mourned the dead including lillian's friends.

During this time she would read in the library to find out more about what her sister had become. She learnt of vampires but also learnt about holy knights who swore a oath of vengeance. After a year of training and working for the guard she decided to swear such an oath to kill her sister and whoever made her what she became. With all her training and study she was ready to begin her journey. She told her parents she was leaving to travel and sell her jewellery but the real reason was far more sinister."}]}

I was orphaned when I was five years old, when my village was attacked by goblins, bugbears and hobgoblins.   I was captured and lived in slavery among the goblinoids for seven years. I managed to escape when I stole back my father's knife, that he had given to me just as the goblins attacked our village to defend myself with and that a goblin had taken at my capture. I used it to slit my jailer's throat and steal the keys and then slit a few more goblin throats in my rage while escaping.

I have been killing goblinoids if I come across them and have thus picked up a little money and a bit of equipment.   My temper had manifested quite early in my life. Even before the goblin attack I was know as wilful and wild and both my parents had terrible tempers - they both killed large numbers of goblins and even bugbears, and my father even took down two hobgoblins all on his own.   My captors soon found out about my rages and after whipping and starving didn't cure me of it, they decided to use me for their entertainment: I was forced to fight in the pits. This, however, helped me with my escape since it gave me much training in fighting, both against animals and humanoids (I was a regular training exercise for young goblins).   Recently, the horde of goblinoids that destroyed my village have started expanding the territory they control southwards, driving people and beasts before them. I have thus been forced to move south, into more civilised lands.   I have since decided that maybe I can find some other people to help me deal with this threat and hope to find them in these more settled areas."}]}

His father was a ranger who lived near the eastern border with his family to keep eyes on the movements of the Orcs. As the warband started pushing further and further west, they were forced to move west as well. When Eaghan was old enough (about 10 probably) his father started teaching him how to handle a bow, and how to survive in the wilderness (basically how to be a ranger like his father). As he grew older and learned more he started joining his father in his expeditions.  As the warband pushed further and further they eventually wound up in the capital, where they stayed for as long as possible while Aldyn continued to teach Eaghan. Eventually, near the end of the siege Moreen convinced them to flee from the capital before it was too late, for the sake of Eoin who had been born about a year before. Eaghan was insistant on not leaving Beleroth behind however. His uncle Morris had told him of a resistance movement being formed by Lady Kathleen Hane and intended to follow his uncle in joining it. Much argueing ensued. Moreen wanted to go to the camps to ensure the safety of both her children. Aldyn admired Eaghan's spirit but placed his family's safety first. Eventually it was decided that Eaghan would go with Morris to join the resistance, while the rest of his family would go south to the dominion, to one of the camps.  In the following years he was guided mostly by his uncle. While his father mostly taught him about stealth, archery and how to survive in the wilderness, Morris educated him in old ways to appease The Giver and request his magical aid (That works right? I'm imagining the components of spells corresponding to mini-rituals of sorts). Eaghan prefered raids at night, since his training and The Giver's magic gave him the advantage over the orcs in the darkness.  While he was very devoted to the cause, he also grew impatient. He felt like no progress was being made, and was still bitter about the Dominion's lack of help in resisting the Warband. He reasoned that if they were to give their full support, and every able Belerothi rised up as well, they could beat the Warband. So he planned on leaving Beleroth (for now) and joining the High Shield. He would try to rise up the ranks and try to get the Dominion to invade Beleroth. After a discussion with his superiors, he left for the Dominion. [Would there be any kind of message they'd want him to pass along? I don't know how much contact there is between the resistance and the Dominion]  He stopped by one of the northen tent camps where his family was supposed to be. He found that his parents were content to settle down, to his disappointment. He then headed to Fort Laham, to join the ranks of the High Shield. He did a few jobs in the area to prove his worth. One of these jobs was to escort a group of Turian pilgrims down south. [I imagine either they were brought to Laketown or he finished the mission and headed to Laketown for further orders, at which point he meets the party?] "}]}

His parents ran a small shop on the outskirts of the city, and Ty grew up there with his brother Sven. One day, Sven was brutally cut down in the course of some gang violence. His parents were never the same again.  They could not accept that their darling boy could be killed so senselessly. They mourned, and grieved, and wailed to the gods to right this grievous wrong; no answer came to them. So they sought out diviners and fortune tellers and mystics who all promised to contact their lost child; no answer. So they used all of their money, sold the shop, went into debt with all the wrong people to seek out clerics to bring him back; the rituals all failed. So they turned to darker paths, and sought to pull their son from the depths of the afterlife through strange and unknown magics; and one goddess took note.  The Raven Queen does not like necromancy. She does not like those who try to cheat death, or pervert the course of life. Ty never saw his parents again. The Raven Queen does not like necromancy, but she is not a cruel goddess. Ty was now alone, and so the Raven Queen sent him a guardian to keep him on the straight and narrow: a small raven called Allie.  With the strength his new ally gave him Ty grew strong living on the streets; he did what he needed to survive, but did his best not to let the Raven Queen's kindness go unnoticed. He was eventually placed into an orphanage where he made friends and found purpose working with an old gnomish chef named Faetra. She taught him everything she knew and gave him a cookbook of his own, one that he keeps with him to this very day. Life was good, for a while.  But all good things come to an end. The city of Bubastis was beset by the Chaos Horde, and the orphanage was destroyed. Ty, his friends, and a few of the younger orphans managed to escape the devastation, but the city is not the same. Gangs of scavengers and goblins roam the streets, and small communities have grown like mold in the dark places.  Ty and the others have found a town house to hole up in, and have built a small community for themselves. They have a garden and some chickens, but it is not enough to feed them all. Sometimes Ty has to go out and get meat from... other sources. Sabriel can't even eat regular food any more, and needs a special diet that doesn't bear thinking about.

In recent days his faith has been tested. The church of the Raven Queen has been re-opened after the attack, but the new priest is not who he seems to be. His faith is weak, and his desire for followers is strong. Ty has also been courted by a patron from Below, though his faith in his goddess has not yet been shaken.

There was nothing she couldn't she.  She always got in on the crazy bets that often ended with her bloodied or . \" 1 gold you won't wrestle that bugbear.\" \"1 gold says I can sit on that cactus longer than you.\" \"one Gold you won't ride this catapult.\"   That last one is what got her in this last predicament. No body expected her to fly so high. Nobody thought about the fact that she only weighed  a fraction of the normal ammunition. It threw her so high, she never came back down.  Fortunetly for her she flew so high she only fell a few feet onto the edge of a massive island that was floating in the sky. While exploring the island she came upon a Laboratory. Seeing as it was getting late, she decided to find a place in there to sleep.  While in there she saw many things that she did not recognize. all kinds of trinkets and gadgets she had never seen before. She also saw a variety of weapons she recognized, but seemed a little... different than they usually do. She found a pair of throwing axes that she thought looked cool.   While she continued to explore the facility she eventually found what looked like 3 small metallic huts that had connecting glass chimneys for some reason. the middle hut was closed so Kansif figured it must be occupied. In her excitement of finding a place to sleep she accidentally clasped the two throwing axes together which caused them seemingly fuse together into one large battleaxe. Startled by this she drops the axe and stumbles back. Thinking the ax is cursed she leave it there end enters the hut on the left.  As soon as she does the hut's doot automatically shuts behind her.   She is troubled by the fact that she tries to find a way to open the hut but she can't seem to figure out how. Being extremely tired she decides she will figure it out when she wakes up. When she is just about to fall asleep she hear's the sound of something scraping against the floor out side quickly followed by someone shouting \"Shit!\" she then hears the sound of something large hitting the ground followed by what sounds like the other door closing and there was a great big flash. Everything just changed. Her molecules got all rearranged.   When she first woke up she noticed she didn't feel nearly as large as she was before. the second thing she noticed was that this new body of hers didn't respond to her and seemed to move on it's own. This freaked her out trying in vain to control her own body which seemed to be looking around for something. Then she said not of her own volition and in an unfamiliar voice \"hello? who's there? I can't see you. wait... is that my voice?\"...  Lorraine Reilly: As a competitive Dungeons and Dragons player she knows every book inside and out. She takes pride in playing the strictly by the rules. Her many characters were carefully crafted to fulfill the specific roles they were made to fill. Anyone using \"home-brew\" material obviously don't know the joy of playing the game in it's purist form.  One day she woke up in a strange place. Not sure what was going on she took out her cell phone and found she had no signal. Looking around she realized she was in some sort of lab. While exploring the lab trying to figure out what was going on, she came upon a weird machine that had 3, what looked like, small rooms. All but the right most room were closed.  Not sure what to think of this Sci-fi contraption she decided to take a closer look. Because she was so taken aback by this machine, she failed to notice the large battleaxe that was laying on the ground. Because of this, she tripped and fell into the room on the  right.   As soon as she was in the room, the door shut behind her and there was a great big flash. Everything just changed. Her molecules got all rearranged   When she first woke up she realized everything part of her body felt swollen, not hurt, just bigger and heavier than she remembered. As she gathered herself she thought  \"wait what am I wearing? and who is that freaking out? maybe I should say something.\"  She decided to call out to the the person who seemed to be paralized  \"hello? who's there? I can't see you.\" As she said this she realized that her voice didn't sound like her own. \"wait... is that my voice?\"  Lorraine-Kansif Reilly : Eventually they both realized  that they had been fused together.  after Lorraine finishes freaking out about her new appearance and realizes she eventually realizes she is in a D&D world and is appalled  when she realizes that she is in some shitty home-brew setting or else all this technology would not be here.  who needs Synths mucking up her fanticy games anyways? Kansif things she is crazy.   The decide to try and reverse the fusion, but the device that fused them together seems to be able to only fuse things. realizing this but not her own strength, Lorraine accidentally breaks the machine. She eventually picks up the Battleaxe that Kansif kept calling cursed and figured out how it worked.   Lorraine and Kansif did not get along at first, but eventually learned to like each other after spending 5 years literally together stuck on this island with only the dredge there to talk to. and by talk I mean kill. and they are now best friends and get along famously. They decided if they ever made it back to society they would go by \"Lorif\"   During one of their endeavors they found a bracelet that granted them the power of time travel. They could only use it to revert themselves back to as they were a few seconds ago while everything else seemed to view it as them teleporting and/or healing. This got them out of a lot of tight jams seeing as they did not have natural healing abilities, and the time jumps made running away a bit easier for them, though they could only use the bracelets once every minute.  One day Lorif found what appeared to be a solid cloud. They eventually were able to figure out that it was actually a piece of technology that you could fly on by standing on it and using your feet to direct it. Wanting to test fly it they headed outside. and while they are doing so they realize they could get off Laputa and go to the main land. Though, even with the dredge, the island had become their home over the past year and they weren't sure if they were ready to leave. As soon as they decided they wanted to stay on Laputa a gust of wind knocked them off of the cloud which drifted vaugly downward as they plummeted.  What will Lorif do in this situation? will they figure a way out of this? will they be crushed by the ground below? Find out what happens to them on the next episode of Dragon Ball Z!"}]}

Orphaned at the early age of 33 when mother died.   This made him even sadder  At 66 he realized he had magic potential and found he could channel it with his instrument.   Became great at casting a minor Illusion in cities to hide his pointed ears to hide the fact that he is half-elf  Eventually he became so good at it he is now able to completely change what he looks like if he needs to with his magic.  Eventually he figured out how to manipulate this change in look to walk around as an independent image that he can manipulate freely.  Because of his rough past, he doesn't like getting close to people, strangers in particular  Fell in with a small time half breed thieving group who were mostly half orcs and half elves where he learned to speak orc.  Because of his musical and magical talents everyone started calling him \"Bard\"  This group and upgrade in name made him slightly less sad  He was still a bit of an outsider in the group because of his tendency to only play songs in minor keys and temper towards people that tried to make him less sad through pep talks.  the hole not liking to get close to people thing didn't help either when they were supposed to be thieves  to get around the last issue he developed a way to conjure a magic hand that he used to rope people from afar.   he eventually got good enough at making these temporary magic constructs that he can now summon an invisible minion that can do steel for him.  he figured out that by using both his image and servant spells he could make an actual physical human.  he did this by having the construct get caught stealing in a shop he was in and taking what he wanted when the owner chased after the construct.  Some of the half-breeds were not able to speak common so he developed a spell that translated other languages into a form he could understand.  This group is also where he learned how to use a rapier incase the bard ever needed to defend himself and his charming good looks didn't.  The group tended to get into fights with other small groups of bandits,  and groups of people who hated them for being half breeds(and/or a batched theft).   The group didn't have anyone skilled on healing, so Bard figured out a way to at least lightly heal his comrades.   These were the best years of this sad bards life.  Once when in a town he heard that a group of adventurers that had 2 dwarf brothers in it were hired to take out our group.   This is the saddest point in Bard's life.   the only thing that brought him any joy was dancing until a powerful witch cursed him, after he upset her, to no longer be able to dance.  He is currently working on a way to apply the invisibility of his humanoid construct spell with his disguise spell to be able to make himself invisible. as well as   He caries with him 2 sheets of paper with an unfinished song on them.

With their dark eyes, pale skin and brooding demeanour it was either that or vampires. However the de'Valis are an ancient clan who are almost fanatically obsessed with escaping their dark origins, the ancient de'Valis joining with Pelor, God of Life and Summer in an attempt to burn away the darkness of their past.   For centuries, it seemed to work, with Veronika's mother, Merletta, giving birth to Victor, Francis and Theon, Veronika's brothers without issue. However, that all changed on Veronika's 1st name day, during the de'Valis ritual of atonement. Designed to cleanse the child's soul and bind it to Pelor, a raven perched on her crib, interrupting the ritual and turning a strand of her golden hair black, marking her as under The Raven Queen's protection.   The Elders, fearing for the child, locked her away and rigidly trained her in the healing arts, hoping it's light would free her soul from The Raven's grasp. However, Veronika, seeing her brothers' freedom, grew bitter and resentful towards those she saw as honouring their title over family.  She was freed, however, on her 18th name day, when the ritual was attempted again. This time, The Raven Queen herself descended, shaming the family for dishonouring their blood, forcing her into a life she wasn't destined to lead. The family tried to plead their love for Veronika, saying that they were only trying to keep her from the darkness and pain of the world, but her bitterness wouldn't allow her to heed their words and she followed her ancestor to Letherna within The Shadowfell, a realm of Darkness and Shadow.   Finally inheriting her true powers, but ignorant, The Raven Queen soul-bound Veronika to the soul of an adventurer in a far flung realm of the Primaterial Plane, the dashing Elven rogue, Vy'dan Vexalis, allowing them to converse across the cosmos. Through him, Veronika learnt the combat of darkness, to use stealth and shadow to destroy the Undead that stood as an affront to both The Raven Queen and Pelor.   Tragedy struck when Vy'dan was felled by a great necromancer and raised as a ghoul. The stress of the broken connection and the sorrow at her friend's loss, both physically and spiritually, had a profound effect on Veronika. Unable to avenge him, or release him from his torment, she fell to the Sorrow of The Shadowfell, her golden hair fading to ash as the light and life were drained from her. In hopes of saving her life and restoring her light, The Raven Queen sent her back to the Material Plane and her family. However, upon returning to her temple, she found it abandoned, profaned with the symbols of Orcus, God of Undeath and enemy to The Raven Queen. Shamed by her callous dismissal of her family's love, Veronika vowed to find them, and avenge them if need be."}]}

The scandalous affair and pregnancy wasn't able to be hidden by house Demara, due to Haisa being too indiscreet about both.  After Eyrdway was born (on May 21st, of 487 AD) his mother was cast out of their house and married off to a \"low-class\" wood elf merchant, Thema Brimo, who was a rich member of the Alchemist's Guild.  Eyrdway grew up in comfort, with tales of elves from his mother and interest in the pursuit of knowledge from his step-father.  As Saxifrage had need to visit the libraries of Arkanne with some regularity he would contact Haisa when he stayed in Haynhold, but only in secret.  The most Eyrdway ever knew was that Thema wasn't his birth father, but the topic was not discussed in the household further than that, despite Eyrdway's curiosity about his heritage.  Eyrdway began an apprenticeship to an skilled alchemist friend of his father, Kashban Beatbrass, at the age of twelve.  By the age of 18, having become a skilled alchemist, he was imbued with his wild magic sorcerous powers when his master was working with a wizard named Yendri to experiment on a pot of paint from a set of Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments, only to have the work be destroyed in a magical explosion that killed them and grievously injured Eyrdway.  Unknown to Eyrdway at the time was that Carathros, a wizard rival of Yendri, had used a subtle enchantment on Kashban, which caused Kashban to unconsciously sabotage the experiment.  While the resources of Eyrdway's family resources kept him from immediately dying from his injuries, he remained severely burned and in a near coma.  Thus Haisa used a scroll of Sending that Saxifrage had given her and, in secret, Saxifrage arranged for a cleric friend of his to volunteer his services for Eyrdway's benefit.  After the magical healing, it still took many months for Eyrdway to recover. He was left with a hand-sized burn scar over his heart.  Half-way through his nineteenth year, strange events began to occur around him and he slowly realized that he was the cause, thanks to a pulsing that would occur in his scar when the events would happen.  By the time he was twenty, several wild magic surges had happened and few were dangerous enough that he sought out help from wizards in Haynhold.  Through their study and knowledge, he discovered his sorcerous nature and despite their misgivings (and with some \"donations\" from Thema) they quickly taught him enough to allow him to rein in his powers, or so he thought.  Thinking that his problems were past him, Eyrdway tried to start an alchemist's shop in his twenty-second year. Sadly, in his twenty-fourth year, he found that his powers began manifesting without his ability to control them again.  The wizards refused to help him any more, as they did not want the possible side effects of wild magic to bring harm upon them.  Somewhat thankfully, Eyrdway realized that he could keep the wild magic manifestations at bay by casting his spells (but not his cantrips) regularly, upon actual targets.  Thus, in his 24th year, he sold his alchemist's shop and turned to adventuring.  Eyrdway's first adventuring group consisted of Sharplin, a wood elf ranger; Amook, a wood elf druid; and Kalya, a half-elf paladin.  Their adventures took them underground, against various denizens of the Underdark that were causing issues for the villages and farms around Haynhold.  After a couple months of successful adventuring, their group (the Lithe Runners) were defeated by a drow ambush deep underground.  Eyrdway only escaped thanks to a potion of invisibility.  Disheartened from loosing adventuring companions, Eyrdway wanted to take some time off from adventuring.  One of treasures that he had managed to escape with was a wizard's spellbook and something about it drew him too it.  Eyrdway discovered that, for reasons beyond his comprehension, his attempts to study the spells in the book helped keep his need to cast his spells daily at bay.  He attempted to pursue rigorous magical learning in Haynhold, but the wizards there were even more wary of a Wild Mage that had grown beyond his initial power and they would not help him at all.  Eyrdway was not skilled enough to teach himself what he needed and his attempts to manipulate (and sometimes charm) people into helping him drew the ire of Carathros.  In his arrogance, Carathros revealed his place in Eyrdway's fate, but thanks to a wild surge, Eyrdway was able to escape his clutches.  Under pursuit by Carathros and fearing for his life Haisa was once again able to contact Saxifrage.  The powerful Enchanter teleported to Haynhold and, with Haisa revealing to Eyrdway that Saxifrage was his father, whisked Eyrdway away to the far-away city of Hinuedon.  In Hinuedon, Saxifrage was able to trade in some favors, from his many years of diplomatic travel, to have Eyrdway learn the basics of ritual magic from wizards he knew there.  Saxifrage could only stay with Eyrdway for a few days, however. He left Eyrdway with enough resources to complete his education in ritual magic, along with a Bag of Holding that he no longer had a use for and then had to return to the Republic of Huly.  With new-found abilities and tools, a new familiar, and a reference from one of Saxifrage's friends, Eyrdway decided to try his hand at adventuring again.  He was in a strange new land and would have to make his fortune there.  He also wanted to stay out of well-known areas, to keep the ire of Carathros at bay."}]}

He is a half-elf ranger."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thoren is the offspring of a human mother, hailing from Anganor and an elf father who hailed from the High Forest. He was raised until the age of 12 in the house of his maternal grandfather, Seaian Dryadson. Upon reaching maturity, he was sent to the High Forest to learn the ways of the Wood Elves and become a ranger like his elvish father.  As the bastard child of a noble lady, Thoren spent his entire life as an outsider. Rejected by the human children of Anganor, Thoren spent his childhood training for his eventual return to the forest of his father. He spent much of his childhood in the wwoods on the borders of his grandfathers estate, honing his skills as an archer, and tracker. Thoren was raised, primarily, by Tyrus Vicelord, the head of his grandfathers Houseguard. As a Half-elf, Tyrus and his family, were the closest thing Thoren had to a family during his formative years. Though his grandfather allowed him to live on his estate, he was never treated as a member of the Dryadson clan, and upon reaching maturity, he took the name of the man he considered his true father.  Upon reaching the High Forest, Thoren was faced with adapting to a society that was wary of the outside, as well as his heritage. His father, Jamros Woodsoul, was, during his life, the greatest Ranger in his clan. Being renowned both inside the High Forest, and among the humans of neighboring cities for his abilities. His renown as a tracker is what led him to meet Thoren’s mother, Lyanna Dryadson, while adventuring through Anganor. Their torrid, short-lived, affair produced little more than their bastard son. Jamros, though not married upon Thoren’s birth, refused to leave the High Forest to rear his son, striking an agreement with Lyanna’s father, instead, to take the boy when he reached maturity, thus ending any responsibility the Dryadson clan had for Thoren. Thoren met his father for the first time on the eve of his 13th birthday, when Jamros ventured to Anganor to fulfill his debt to the Dryadson clan, and return with his son to the village of Ethyreen, deep in the High Forest.  Upon his arrival in Ehtyreen, Thoren was met with derision, most poignantly from his father’s wife, who cared no more for his mixed heritage than had his grandfather. Jamros’ other children, as full blooded Feywild, were always given favor over their bastard half-brother, causing Thoren to retreat even deeper in to the development of his skills. His half-brothers (Yennan, Thoros, and Traster) were destined to follow in the footsteps of their maternal grandfather, all three becoming Clerics of Melora. Jamros’ adventuring had left them, often, without a male influence other than their grandfather, and they had all sworn off their fathers occupation by the time of Thoren’s arrival (though none had reached maturity at the time). Though Thoren was not accepted by his wife, or the two eldest boys Yennan and Thoros, his youngest half-brother Traster took an instant shine to his older brother, and was the lone source of sibling affection Thoren had.  At the time of Thoren’s arrival, Jamros had become reclusive, choosing to spend his time, primarily, in a small lodge away from the family his wife, Irann, had assumed control over the family. Irann, a daughter of Elven nobility, had not taken kindly to the offer of her hand to Jamros, who was the son of a bard, in return for the rescue of her youngest brother, Traster, from a Drow clan that had made several raids in to the High Forest near Ethyreen. Jamros, who was approaching the age of ninety at the time (shortly after Thoren’s birth) had accepted the offer primarily out of the duty to preserve his line, as he was the last of his name.  Irann had never taken to Jamros’ adveturesome lifestyle, preferring the safety and security of the Wood Elf’s haven in the High Forest. His absentism had led to a rift, especially after Traster’s birth, that drove them apart, leading to Jamros’ self-imposed exile to his hunting lodge. Though he, initially, brought Thoren to the home of his wife, when Thoren’s training began, they lived for months at Feyrun (his fathers lodge deep in the forest). Jamros’ taught Thoren everything he could about tracking, archery, two-handed fighting, and inundated his eldest child with stories of his years in the world of men. Though, eventually, Thoren grew to love his father, he was never able to forgive his fathers abandonment, and refused to adopt the Woodsoul name, refusing, even at his fathers deathbed, to relinquish the name of the only family he ever had.  Upon his father’s death, Thoren left Feyrun and returned to Anganor, reuniting with Tyrus Vicelord just months before his passing. His “brother”, Tytran, a bard of some renown in the Human cities of the low plains, encouraged him to ply his skills in the Human cities in the north, where there was much need for skilled trackers. Tytran, who’s travels had taken him far above the Neck, led his “brother” Thoren off towards Winterfell, where, on his 20th birthday, he encountered a small band of adventurers looking for a tracker to lead them through Wintershold forest.  As a young child, Thoren was visited by a member of his father, Jamros’, clan in he woods near his Grandfathers’ estate. The man, who did not give his name, but called himself Thoren’s Uncle, told Thoren that he must grow to be the man his father could not be.  Not long after Thoren began his formal training with his father, he was targeted for “education” by his younger brothers (save Traster). His brothers, Yennan and Thoros, slipped a non-lethal amoung of nightshade in to his bread, leaving Thoren poisoned and near death for several days. As a result, Thoren is overly suspicious and will rarely eat anything he did not make himself.  Before setting out with his “brother” Tytran on the adventure that brought him to Winterfell, Thoren had a brief, life-changing, encounter with the daughter of his Grandfather’s stable-master, Yehreena. Though he will not admit it openly, he dreams regularly of eschewing the vocation his father imparted on him."}]}

The strict tradition in the trading families of this region is that the first-born son into a sailing family is committed to the family’s ship, which means they are taken away from their mother as soon as they are weaned and grow up on the family ship. Starting from a very young age, they learn every aspect of life at sea and are expected to become proficient (or at least capable) in them all. On their 20th birthday, they go through a blood bonding ceremony with the ship and become First Mate under their father, and later Captain when their father either dies or steps down. In the absence of a son in the family, the responsibility falls to the youngest daughter – this is less than ideal, as it can create situations where the daughter is much older than the traditional heir, but it is also extremely uncommon as the trading families tend to produced large and hardy families.    Farryn Brightwater is the third daughter born to Captain Remi Brightwater and his wife, Liaroris Brightwater (neé Vyshaan). Remi and Liaroris had an arranged marriage by which their parents intended to improve trade prospects between the two families. Remi and Liaroris were cordial but there was never a great affection between them and Remi was away at sea for most of their marriage. Liaroris did become pregnant quickly, but as she was an elf carrying half-humans, she was only able to bear three living offspring -- all girls – and had very difficult pregnancies. After almost dying when Farryn was born, healers ordered her not to fall pregnant again or it would surely kill her. Thus, at the age of three, Farryn was grudgingly taken away from her mother and two older sisters and brought to live and work on the Brightwater’s family ship, the Cascade. Her daily care fell to a sulky cabin boy who knew nothing about children, so Farryn had to learn to fend for herself quite quickly. At first Farryn was very homesick for her mother and her two older sisters, Mialee and Shava, who had doted over their baby sister. Each trading cycles lasts about three months, and as she was still expected to perform her duties onboard the Cascade even in Memnon, she was only allowed a week leave from the ship to be in the family home when the ship was in port. Despite her ambivalence toward her husband, Liaroris was a warm mother who genuinely loved her daughters and was distraught over Farryn being taken away. The visits for the first few years were very emotional and bittersweet. But after a while, each visit became more and more like polite visits with strangers. Farryn saw how close her sisters became to each other and their mother and how much she missed during the time she was away. After awhile she only came home for shorter visits of a day or two.  For many years Farryn worked hard on the Cascade. Her father always seemed disapproving no matter how well she did, so she threw herself into her work and kept pushing harder and harder. She started out as a cabin boy, running errands for crew. As she was waiting to grow and get stronger, she also took her turns assisting the cook in the galley, working as a nurse under the healer, and assisting shipwrights with repair as the needs arose. When she was old enough, she started working as a crew member, manning the sails, cleaning the ship, aiding with repairs, keeping watch, helping load and unload cargo. She learned how to balance cargo, how to operate the catapults on deck, the record keeping necessary for trading, navigation and map charting, and star reading. By her early teens she was doing rounds with the first mate on his daily ship inspections to be sure tasks are completed and everything is running efficiently, repairs are done correctly, etc. Over the years, the other shipmates didn’t know how to relate to her, as she was not only the Captain’s daughter but also female. But she consistently pulled her weight and more, and thus earned their grudging respect and eventually their cautious affection. She was happy with this until her mid-teens when she began to visit other family ships with her father to learn the business of trading. It was then she realized that on ships with male heirs the crew had much more respect and deference, and that the heir was truly treated as the future captain instead of like a mascot. She privately despaired of ever becoming the type of leader that she would need to be in order to command that type of respect. She knew that she would have to work three times as hard as a male in her position would, which made her all the more determined to be the best she could.     When Farryn was sixteen, her mother became very sick. Healers from around the trade route were transported to Memnon and finally, when it seemed there was nothing anyone could do, Farryn’s great-grandfather, the wizard Lianthorn Vyshaan, was transported from his home in Velen to be with his daughter. He was a private and reclusive old man who spent most of his time onboard in his cabin. But when he was on deck or at dinner, Farryn noticed him starting at her intently several times. This scared her a little, so she tried to avoid him after that. Her mother eventually passed away and after the funeral and mourning period, the Cascade started out on the trade route with Lianthorn on board, although this time he stayed exclusively in his cabin and had his meals brought to him. When they were nearing port, the most violent storm Farryn had even seen broke out. The ship was taking on water and sails were tearing and everyone was running around like mad. Even Captain Remi looked worried, which made Farryn terrified. Just when she was sure they would all die at sea, she heard a booming voice and saw her great-grandfather standing on the deck with his arms outspread, casting spells. The violent winds stopped and within a minute the sky above was clear. The water on decks was siphoned neatly back into the sea and with a series of complicated hand gestures the sails were mended and billowed out toward shore again. The decks leveled and Lianthorn looked around slowly, then turned and started shuffling back to his cabin. It was dead silent and the whole crew stood with their mouths open until Captain Remi barked at them to get back to work, as the ship wouldn’t sail itself. Before she returned to her work, Farryn darted over to her great-grandfather and pressed her hand into his. He looked at her with the penetrating gaze again and she felt a tingling in her hand. Then he was back in his room and she didn’t see him again until he debarked in Velen. Later, Farryn overheard a conversation where the other crewmen discussed reverently how amazing the wizard’s feats had been and how they wish they had those powers. But soon they were laughing and imagining how much time it would take to learn and how dull learning wizardry was likely to be. That was when Farryn began to long to become a wizard. She had always been resigned, if not satisfied, that she would eventually become Captain of her beloved Cascade, but for the first time in her life she wished fervently that she wasn’t the ship’s heir. But she was, and there was nothing she could do about it, so she pushed the dream aside as best she could and carried on.  Shortly after her mother passed away, a new crew member came on board – a boy the same age as Farryn named West Calabra. The Calabras weren’t a trading family, so it was a little odd, but not completely out of the ordinary. West has to work just as hard as Farryn did to earn the trust and respect of the crew, but in short time he is very well liked. Despite Farryn being a little jealous at how quickly West is accepted by the crew, she can’t help but like him, as he’s very affable and continued to share her work ethic. As somewhat outsiders among the crew, the two became unlikely fast friends. For Farryn, this was the first time in her life that she had a close friend and confidante, which was an amazing feeling. Farryn and West worked side by side, covered each other’s watches when they were sick or exhausted and she began to teach him navigation at his request. He told her about growing up without a father as the only child of a poor bard and she told him about never getting to know her mother and wishing she knew her sisters better. They discussed trading and other ships West has worked on and the best meals they’ve had in ports. Farryn even confessed that although she loves the Cascade and her life at sea, she longs to learn wizardry so she can train to become a Ship’s Wizard and better protect the ship from the stormy seas, sea monsters, and pirates. West didn’t laugh at her like she was afraid he might, but told her earnestly how good she’d be at wizardry. At first, she developed a bit of a crush, but West kept her firmly at arm’s length. Regardless, this was the happiest time in Farryn’s life and for the first time she started to look forward to being Captain of the Cascade with West as her First Mate.  The winter before Farryn and West were set to turn 20 (when Farryn would officially take over as First Mate) West’s mother fell ill. He got more worried and withdrawn each time the Cascade stopped in his home port of Calimport. Meanwhile, Farryn got more and more nervous about making the switch to First Mate, worried what it will mean for her friendship with West and relationship to the rest of the crew and whether any of them will take her seriously. Finally, in mid-summer, a month before Farryn’s birthday and days until West’s, the Cascade returned to Memnon. Before disembarking, West cornered Farryn and asked her if she could, would she give up becoming captain of the ship so she could learn wizardry. Surprised and confused, she said yes. West nodded and took her with him to her father’s quarters where he revealed that he is Remi’s bastard son and under the laws of the land is claiming his birthright to become captain of the Cascade. His mother is very sick and needs money for healers, rare medicines, and better quarters.    Farryn and her father were stunned. But before long, the story came out – Remi met West’s mother, Yetta, in Calimport (one of the mainland trading ports) when he was young and training to take over the Cascade from his father. They kept meeting up in Calimport over the years and eventually their friendship turned into love. When Remi found out that his parents were setting up an arranged marriage, he was devastated, but knew he could never ask his parents to marry a poor girl from a non-trading family. He wanted to run away with her but was afraid of his future wife’s great-grandfather, who was a powerful wizard. He went through with the wedding, but still saw Yetta in secret when he could. Remi was miserable and finally told Yetta that seeing her was too painful – Liaroris was pregnant and he had to turn his attentions to her and his future children as best he could. Yetta never told him that she was also pregnant, because she knew that his wife’s family would likely kill him. So she raised her son on her own and never told anyone who his father was, but pined after Remi for all those years. When West was old enough, he asked about his father and she told him the whole story but begged him not to tell anyone. West was curious, so he worked hard on several trading ships and eventually secured a position on the Cascade -- not with any intentions, only so he could get to know his father. His friendship with Farryn was an unexpected but pleasant surprise, and his affection toward his half-sister was genuine. He knew he would never risk hurting her by revealing the truth about his father, so he resolved to work hard enough and hopefully become First Mate one day. But then his mother got sick and forced his hand.  Captain Remi became very emotional while listening to this story, and to Farryn’s surprise, he got up and hugged West for a long time. Farryn, who was in shock and felt deeply betrayed by West, ran out of the room and off the Cascade. She asked around and found a foreign merchant ship that was leaving for Velen that afternoon that would give her passage in exchange for her working on the ship. They cast off before her father can find her and before she can lose her nerve. She missed the Cascade terribly, but every time she thought about her father or West her resolve hardened. She got along wonderfully with the crew, who don’t know her true identity, and by the time they arrived in Velen they offered her a job. She was tempted to take it and just disappear forever, but when she looked to the dock, her great-grandfather was standing there waiting for her. She went to him and he looked at her for a long time and then wordlessly lead her back to his sea-side home. She finally asked him if her father had gotten word to him somehow and he said that no, he knew she was coming through his powers. He asked her to tell him what happened. Too afraid to lie, she blurt out the truth and told him she wanted him to teach her wizardry. He was silent for a long time. Farryn wondered if the ship already left, or if she could still take the job working on it. Finally, Lianthorn told her that if she is serious about learning wizardry he will teach her, but in order to prove that she’s a serious student, she must stay in his house and study alone for one full year. If she reads and studies every day for a year, then at the end of the year he will teach her. She was nervous, but agreed to the terms. She was given a room and shown the massive library and then left to her own devices.  Farryn, true to her word, began her year of study. After a couple of days of her bumbling around not knowing where to start, Lianthorn began leaving books out for her in the library, although she rarely saw or spoke to him. Her great-grandfather employed a half-orc woman, Umag, who prepared food and kept the house running. Umag spoke mostly Orcish, so Farryn dedicated some time to learning it and they were able to get along well after that. She got the impression that her great-grandfather had helped Umag’s family and she was repaying a life-debt by working for him. Although Farryn was still angry and grieving and lonely and was very unaccustomed to living on land, her days began to take shape – in the mornings she would get up at dawn and study in the library until Umag brought a late brunch and tea. After eating, she would take a walk through the property’s gardens, then back to studying until dinner, which was served at a table and attended infrequently by her great-grandfather. After dinner she would walk down to the shore to stare at the horizon and put her feet in the sea. After week of this routine, Umag came to her and told her that her great-grandfather had a small sailboat that he was willing to let her use. After that she took the boat on the water every day after dinner, regardless of weather. When she returned after her sail, she would tidy her room and read until she fell asleep. One day a week, she ventured down to the port, disguising herself a bit, to get news of the trading families. She learned that her father had reunite with Yetta and that West had bonded to the Cascade. He and her father were running a new trade route together up the Sword Coast. The ship she booked passage with occasionally is in port and tried to convince her to come back to sea, which is tempting at times.  She continued like this for the entire year, never missing a day of study, and when the one year anniversary came, Lianthorn was waiting for her in the library and began to teach her the wizardly arts. He was a good and fair teacher, although he was never particularly warm to her. He did catch him looking at her intently at times, which she guessed was because she looked so much like her mother. He did seemed pleased when she progressed quickly and proved a competent wizard, and told her that he knew when he saw her on the ship that he would teach her one day. She asked if her mother knew magic and to her surprise he said yes, but then no more. She stopped talking about her mother and threw herself even more into practice and studies. She still went down to the sailboat every day, and as she learned simple spell and cantrips she practiced mending the sails, shooting firebolts into the sea, and seeing through the eyes of a raven familiar.    She continued to train and become a more powerful wizard, and eventually her great-grandfather told her that her formal training would be done and that in one week, it will be time for her to move on. Farryn had been expecting this and after several years is ready to make her peace with her father and West, so she made arrangements to return to her home. On the day she is set to leave, Lianthorn met her in the library and praised her work ethic and skill, and told her that he was very happy to have had the chance to teach her. As she smiled and thanked him, his demeanor changed and he told her that they never discussed payment. Farryn balked, confused, and her great-grandfather said that it wasn’t her he was seeking payment from, it was her father. She listened horrified while he ranted and raved about the captain that was unfaithful to his favorite granddaughter and broke her heart and then repeated his sins when he cheated his favorite great-granddaughter out of her birthright and similarly broke her heart. Farryn tried to stop him and defend her father, but her pleas fell on deaf ears and before she knew it, he had gone into a type of trance and cast a powerful curse on her father, then stormed out of the room.  Farryn hurried home as fast as she could, but Remi was already quite sick by the time she arrived. He seemed relieved to see her, though, and on his deathbed confessed that during her absence, he and West had become involved with a group called the Cult of the Dragon. The Cult paid him to smuggle goods across the Sword Coast. Wracked by guilt, he begged Farryn to promise him that she would investigate the cult and undo the evil he may have helped foster. He urged her to travel to a town called Greenest. Farryn abhorred the thought of being inland for so long when she only just got back, but she also felt extremely guilty about and blamed herself for her father’s death. Immediately after Remi’s burial at sea, she snuck off and secured passage to Candlekeep with a merchant vessel.  At the start of our adventure, Farryn is sailing into Candlekeep – it would be a more direct route with more towns along the way if she sailed into Baldur’s Gate, but she’s still trying to process everything that’s happened (her father’s death, finding out he was involved in smuggling for the cult, her grandfather’s betrayal) and has always been uneasy in big cities, so she doesn’t mind camping along the way instead of staying at inns. Plus, she remembers a delicious meal she had in The Burning Wizard tavern in Beregost and Farryn never forgets a good meal.   Her plan is to start out in the fortress libraries at Candlekeep to see if she can learn anything out about the Cult of the Dragon and/or Greenest, then take the Way of the Lion path to the Coast Way, where she will head south to Beregost for supplies (and her good meal). She’ll decline to stay in any of the three inns in Beregost and instead elect to camp along the road when she heads south on the Coast Way. Then she’ll continue to head south until she picks up the road into Greenest. "}]}

Some hundred miles away from the coast itself, protected by the surrounding Shaeradim Mountains is Evereska, one of the Sword Coast's largest settlements. It's known as the last haven of the elves. “Fortress Home” in the common tongue is the last and only standing Elven stronghold in all of Faerun. Encircled by mountains and dense forest, Evereska sits atop a plateau more than 1000 feet above the forest floor making it very difficult for outsiders to get to.  Evereska is surrounded by a large magical force known as a mythal that not only acts as a protective barrier but also serves to control weather, regulate sickness and disease, allow large objects to be floated and has many other magical properties. The mythal also allows the citizens of Evereska to climb walls, ceilings and other surfaces like insects. The Eladrin that inhabit Evereska live with and use magic in all its different forms in their daily life. Made up of primarily moon elves, Evereska is no stranger to humans and even a handful of half elves.   Tavneiros was known as not only the youngest Eladrin of the high council that governed over Evereska, but the only one to take a human wife. While it was not necessarily looked down upon in their society, Tavneiros was definitely an anomaly among his people. Kine Stokk, Tavneiros’ wife was born to one of the smaller noble houses in Baldurs Gate. A short rather petite figure with creamy pale skin, emerald green eyes and shoulder length auburn curls, Kine stands a striking figure next to her husband's pale blue complexion, raven hair and glowing pupil less blue eyes.  One dark night, an ominous arcane storm was brewing over Evereska. It wasn't unheard of that the magic holding the mythal together could be unstable, but it was so rare that most Eladrin may only see one storm like this in their life while others may only hear about them. Tavneiros was apprehensively ecstatic, for Kine was pregnant and just happened to go into labor tonight, but he was unsure if the storm was a good or bad omen. The storm was as beautiful as it was frightening. Shimmering golden drops of rain poured down from dark clouds as bright powerful streaks of purple lightning flashed across the sky. Tavneiros kneeled beside his wife's head, stroking her damp hair in an attempt to soothe her while two priests and a cleric of The Seladrine tended to her other needs  A loud crack of thunder boomed drowning out a scream from Kine and just a few minutes later a baby's cry. It's a girl one of the priests said as he presented the child with very Elven features and straight jet black hair just like her father. Another looming boom of thunder and an even louder scream of pain from Kine, the priest surprised held a second child in his arms a boy this time with curly hair like his mother but it was shining silver in the moonlight. As the cleric was starting her blessings of the children, she realized that they had identical birthmarks in the shape of a bird. She knew it was clearly a sign from Aerdrie, the bringer of rain and storms, the Lady of air and wind, the Queen of the Avariel.  Growing up as the children of a noble wasn't easy for these two. Rivorthel and Celephindor were afforded many luxuries that other children growing up in Evereska weren't. Even though they were never chastised for being half-elven, their father felt as though he needed to make sure they were smarter, stronger and better taught than all the other children to make up for it. As it was it seemed that the twins were born gifted, touched by the arcane instability of the mythal during their birth. They both had an unnatural affinity for magic and the arcane arts. Most of the other children of Evereska teased them for the amount of time they spent with tutors and reading books that the others couldn't afford. Being teased by all the other children only made them grow closer together the older they got.  Shortly after their birth, their mother became very ill. One of the priests ruled that it was most likely due to the level of energy from the mythal present at the time and her human body not being used to or able to handle it. Celephindor or Celeb as his mother called him grew very close to his mother in the few years that she was alive. Eladrin aren't known for having strong emotions and even less for showing them, but Celeb shared his mother's very human range of strong emotions. He let his emotions guide his actions and decisions, probably more than he should have and definitely more than his father liked. Celeb was a very frail child, always much smaller and weaker than his older sister. However none of the elders versed in the arcane arts had ever seen one single person possess so much raw arcane power and with no training or spellbook.   As Celeb grew older, he realized his power much like the mythal itself was incredibly powerful but potentially unstable. In an effort to learn to control his powers, Celeb read every book he could get his hands on hoping that if he gained more power he could stabilize his magic. What he found was that he just really enjoyed reading and even though scripts on the arcane arts and history books were his favorite, the subject didn't matter, he just liked to read. He was somewhat of an introvert, often lost in his books and research and found it hard to trust anyone besides his sister.  Ever since birth, Rivor felt a strong need to protect her younger brother, even laying into a few of the older boys that took to teasing Celeb about his frailty. After their mother's death, even though she was still a child, Rivor felt terrible that she wasn't able to help in anyway. It was from then on that she knew she would use her powers to help and heal others. She devoted much of her time to learning about The Seladrine, Aerdrie Faenya in particular, who was said to be the cause of the arcane storm that blessed them with their powers. She swore she would never let anything happen to those she loved ever again and with her devotion she became the youngest cleric of The Seladrine in Evereska’s history.  Much like her brother, she loved to read and had an affinity for languages. However, most of her time was devoted to religious texts, focusing her arcane prowess in the arts of healing. She took to healing and helping as many people around Evereska as she could. She quickly became known all across Evereska for her ability to quickly heal wounds, soothe emotions and even bless people and objects.  If it wasn't for their difference in hair, the twins would have been identical. Rivor had long straight jet black hair and a lithe but powerful build. A mix of their parents, she had a creamy pale complexion with undertones of blue primarily across her cheekbones and around her ears and eyes. Her ears were long and pointed just like her father's and her almond shaped pupil less eyes were a deep shade of violet. She usually wore fine Eladrin made golden armor with teal accents, the colors of their house. Her hair was normally held back by an ornate golden circlet, except for a single braid that fell over her right shoulder.  Celeb had soft curls that fell to his shoulders, shining silver like the light from the moon. As he got older for some reason, he took to shaving half of his head and leaving the other side a mess of thick curls. Like his sister, the signature pale blue of the Eladrin was present across his face. With his long pointed ears and deep pupil less violet eyes, if the twins had no hair they'd be almost impossible to tell apart. Celeb most often wore flowing teal robes held together with shimmering gold thread. It wasn't abnormal for noble born Eladrin to adorn themselves with jewelry of all types as Celeb usually wore a golden chain that hung from his right ear, the other side attached to his right nostril. The only thing Celeb was never without was the dull greyish black stone he wore as a pendant around his neck, given to him by his mother it was his last connection to her. "}]}

The child thought of themself as a third gender-neutral diminutive.   As the child grew, they showed signs of significant fighting skills, and of quick learning. In their teen years they were recruited into the settlement's guard against the malevolent creatures that occasionally came from the Underdark. This became a bright point in their life, and remained so until one day when they were in their mid-30s and the settlement suffered an attack by three dragons simultaneously. There was only one survivor, and that was just barely.  The lone survivor was discovered by clerics from a not-far-distant settlement who had felt called to the area. The clerics spent months helping the burnt, broken, and despondent patient regain health, only to be rewarded with their disappearance in the night.  Dropping their original name and going solely by their clan name, Grim began to wander the wilds of Faerun. Eventually they stopped, deep in the Border Forest, built a small house (among Grim's skills is masonry), and settled into their hermitage.  For decades, Grim lived alone, only dealing with the creatures (humanoid and not) of the forest. Then one day they felt an irresistible call. Berronar Truesilver spoke to them in a way that they knew she usually only spoke to her trained and chosen faenor. Grim was told to return home and seek a place to train.  Following where they felt Berronar lead them, Grim returned to the East Rift, specifically to the settlement where some of his cleric saviours hailed from. Grim was taken in, trained, and achieved Cleric status fairly quickly, despite an occasionally surly attitude toward Berronar, who Grim felt should have protected their former clan.

This character is a tabaxi rogue."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A cat from humble beginnings; Lock on an Open Door (Lock to those who know him) hails from outside the forested town of Croy. Born to Key with no Teeth (Mother) and Open Door to a Safe (Father), Lock spent his childhood studying under his parents as a locksmith, while playing with the other Tabaxi children in their small tribe. Always a great storyteller, Key told many grand tales of her ancestors in Talvar. She told stories of a master locksmith in the family from many generations ago working closely with Talvari royalty. Cage with no Bars once was a servant to the King, but at some point proved himself and became the King’s personal locksmith. He designed intricate and beautiful locks and safes for the King’s vast riches. Some stories go that Cage’s fleeting fancies led him outside of Talvar; others that he outlived his usefulness and the King sent him away to find other work; while yet others insist that he was banished for trying to steal from the very safes he created. Whatever the case, Lock knew from a young age that Talvar was where he wanted to call home eventually. The fantastical stories that his mother would tell painted vivid pictures in the curious cat’s mind of unending mystery, unbound opportunity, rich stories to be heard, and limitless new knowledge. However, as it usually is, stories turned out to be far from reality. Shortly after arriving in Talvar around his 16th birthday, Lock found himself getting bored with urban life. Sure there was the fascinating technology, the fast talking merchants, and exuberant bards; but life it seemed, whether in the forests around Croy or in the busy streets of Talvar; was never as interesting as the greatest stories promised. That is, until Lock met a man name Tilbius Cortingham. Tilbius was a dashing man who told the most epic of tales. Endless stories poured fromTilbius to Lock over countless ales. Only the stories told by Tilbius were different than other stories. These stories had real, tangible ties to the City of Water and Storms. Every story came with a task; tasks that Lock could fixate on and then forget about with just as much ease. It started out small; a story of a beautiful gem freed from an underwater grave; a note written to an illicit lover by some political figure.  Eventually though, the stories became more elaborate, tasks more complex. Tilbius would ask Lock to hunt down men and women who had perpetrated high profile crimes against the state. He would send him on clandestine missions to covertly apprehend political rivals of those in power. For Lock, this was the ultimate opportunity to learn the secrets of Talvar. It was the purest form of obsession. The thrill of the hunt, and then the wiping of paws from the situation; it was his true calling. Without even realizing it he had been inducted into The Relentless (or The Gold Hand), a guild working alongside the law whose prime objective is to bring to justice those most elusive of criminals and retrieve the things no one else can retrieve. It’s been several years now since Lock arrived in Talvar and since he has seen his family. After his most recent bounty he decided to take a trip back home to see his mother and father and tell his own stories this time around. Lock possesses a nearly insatiable obsession. Of what? Well, just about anything. It changes from bounty to bounty; story to story; hour to hour. Once Lock has fixated on something he pursue it with an undying fanaticism until he’s gotten what he wants, or something more interesting comes along. He has a compulsive curiosity that can sometimes get him into trouble, but he has been working diligently to curb his compulsions.  Maybe it’s a side effect of the obsession, or maybe it’s some innate ideal; but Lock displays amazing devotion to those who are able to provide him with a steady stream new stories, new obsessions, or juicy secrets. The flip side of this, of course, is that an object of devotion can easily fall out of favor for new, more interesting people with new, more interesting information. Few doubt Lock’s ability. It is one of his few obsessions that never retreats. He is always pushing his own personal boundaries, whether physically, mentally, or socially in hopes of becoming a more perfect bounty hunter. Lock keeps a tight circle of trusted individuals. His parents, Key and Safe, never quite leave the back of his mind. Tilbius continues to be a great mentor to the Tabaxi hunter. These three individuals are among the few people for whom Lock would sacrifice himself with little thought. Aside from the odd acquaintance in Talvar, there is but one other person that holds a spot in Lock’s circle of interest. The half-elven daughter of a baker in Talvar’s market district, Taelyn Isdara first won Lock’s attention with her famous mince pies. However, her knack for baking was no match for her stories, and neither for her beauty. The two have been casual friends, sharing stories and cuisine on a consistent basis, but Lock’s obsession may be turning into a romantic interest, something he is far from familiar with. Something he’s not all too comfortable with. Not to mention, Taelyn’s father has strong prejudice against anyone who isn’t pink of skin and pointy of ears."}]}

His mother, Aeria, an elvish whore from Solindra, was never in the picture. Upon learning of the pregnancy, she immediately made arrangements for Kaarl to take custody of the child as is customary in that region of the realm. Kaarl was always tough on the boy. Solindar’s elven blood sullied his image in his father’s eyes, not to mention his lacking desire to carry on the Sindel-family tradition of logging. No, Solindar was always the odd duck in the Sindel household. His two brothers, Kaaden and Jeral, always took their father’s favor. It reached a point, somewhere around the age of 14, where Solindar was denied sustenance unless he took up logging. He was more interested in divinity, and frankly, the thought of chopping down trees sickened him – surely a trait of his elven heritage. In order to survive, Solindar took to the streets performing small cons to earn enough coin to buy his own food. As it turned out, Solindar was particularly good at conning people. His strong charisma and deep knowledge of religion resonated with just about anyone, allowing him to make a decent living as a faith healer, albeit a phony one. To his surprise, some of his marks were indeed healed, found good fortune, or were just so taken with him that when his services didn’t work they just shrugged it off. This ruse went on for several years until the summer of his 17th birthday, when he conned the wrong man. A travelling merchant came to Solindar to be cured of a particularly severe necrotic blight. Solindar performed a convincing ritual, painting the man’s afflicted areas with a flesh-colored ointment and advising him the blight would surely subside in a couple days’ time. The merchant left town after paying Solindar a handsome fee.  Several days later the merchant returned, furious that the blight was not only not cured, but was spreading faster than before. The merchant, Ygnolio Frustram was connected to a local crime syndicate known as The Brotherhood of Black Ties. When he returned to Jaarstead he brought with him a gang of Black Ties Enforcers to punish the charlatan.  By the time Ygnolio and the Black Ties left Jaarstead, Kaarl, Kaaden, and Jeral had all been slaughtered. Solindar was left alive if not severely crippled. His left knee had been crushed by a mace, which would leave him with a lifelong limp. Ygnolio also burned the Mark of Black Ties onto his back, ensuring that he would forever owe his life to the Brotherhood.  "}]}

She was used to being carefree & this was encouraged by her parents, who were similar. When she struck out on her own, she found an adventuring party and wrote back to her parents frequently. After a few years, she heard from her parents that they were giving up their sea-faring lifestyle and moving inland, which struck her as odd. She cut ties with her adventuring party (involving angst, since none of them cared enough to return with her, despite the fact they'd been friends for years) and went to check on her parents, to find that they were all right, but getting a bit too old for that lifestyle. She devoted herself to caring for them as they aged, and helped as much as she could, but still lost them when she was around 40 years old. She decided to stay in their house (basically in the middle of nowhere in the woods) and withdraw from interacting with others, coming to terms with her parents' deaths. She continued to hone her talents as a ranger, hunting and foraging for food and survival. She eventually befriended a fishing cat who became her familiar - named Blue, after her preference for bluefin tuna in the river near their prowling grounds. She was brought out of retirement and met her current party (at the start of this campaign) through a contract that the dean of a somewhat-nearby university specifically requested her for, to kill a lich that had been terrorizing the area. Vaana, having a strong preference for the natural order of things over necromantic leanings, felt a calling to join up and fight, and brought Blue with her.

She faded fast, but the last thing she did before she died was to petition the Duke for an audience. Her friendship with the Duke’s elven MasterHarper probably helped. Siegfried was too young to realise what was being discussed and was more interested in Baby Leopold, squalling in the arms of his mother, the Duchess. He sang to little Leo, the same lullaby his mother sang to him, and the babe settled, much to the Duchess’s surprise and relief.  Shortly after, his mother passed away and the MasterHarper came to collect him and his things to move into Appin Castle. It was a strange upbringing. The Duke treated him as his own son, making no secret to him that that was indeed who he was. The Duchess, however, made sure he realised he was a bastard and that the dukedom would be Leo’s. Only the loyal retainers were included in the secret. Whenever company came, Siegfried was seated at the far end of the hall, with the musicians and militia. Siegfried didn’t mind at all. He was allowed to learn all the musical instruments and performance the Harper would teach him, self-defense and horsemanship from the Hand of the Duke, politics and presence from the Duke himself. Leo taught him how to be noble and, in return, Siegfried taught him how to have fun - also much to the disgust of the Duchess. One day, he would be Leo's MasterHarper, singing him songs and watching out for his little brother.  Then the Duke died. A tragic hunting accident. Before he was cold in the ground, the Duchess had taken Siegfried to one side to tell him he was no longer welcome at Appin. He had until nightfall to remove himself and his belongings, not even enough time to speak to Leo, who was still at the memorial service with the Harper. It was tempting to disobey her - pretend to go but hide either in the nearby village or even the bowels of the Castle itself. It had tunnels aplenty and he and Leo had explored most of them, but she had sent guards to “help” him with his things and when one of them offered to carry his lute, giving them the slip came with a price he wasn’t prepared to pay.  It wouldn’t matter - he would survive, learn, develop his skills. He could come back to Appin and be an even better Harper to Leo than he would have been had he stayed. Yes, that was what he would do. "}]}

All shepherds know that leaving the others behind to go looking for that one little lost lamb is madness - why risk losing ninety-nine just to rescue that one troublemaker who’s probably going to go and do it again tomorrow, just to spite you. But all Good Shepherds know, that’s exactly what you do. Which is why Torak was halfway down the chasm, cursing the sheep that was trotting along, sure-footed ahead of him, while he was sliding on loose skree, nursing an already-twisted knee and wondering how far this crevice he’d tried so hard to keep the flock away from for so long actually went and whether he could catch the blasted thing before it took him all the way to the Underdark. As he rounded the next turn, the sheep had disappeared from view. It took him a split second, and the feeling that that he’d made a huge mistake accompanied by the sudden drop for him to realise the remains of the pathway he’d been trying to follow had dropped out and now, so had he. It was some minutes later that he recovered consciousness, bruised, bloody and broken. The top of the crevice was almost out of sight so far above him.

To his surprise, what should have been handfuls of soft, warm wool wasn’t there at all... in its place a man stood, shining in the dark.

Will you work for me?” Torak felt a strange sensation of calm flow over him and for a moment, it was only the two of them - no crevice, no rocks, no pain. “They do wander off so and the more of us there are to keep an eye on them, the better, don’t you think?” “Are... are you...?” “Yes.” Torak dropped to his knees, “Oh, my Lord, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to say those things, well, I mean I did obviously, but not like that. I...” “Hush now. You think I don’t know you well enough to understand the difference?” the man reached out a glowing hand to Torak, gesturing for him to take the assistance to rise to his feet. “What you say about me is of no import, what work you do for me is. Now, rise again Shepherd, like the sun also rises. There is much work to be done.” "}]}

As is the case with all jaguar lords, Tonauac's father was one, and his father before him, and so on, until the beginning of time. Jaguar lords can only produce male jaguar lord offspring. My brother Ehecatl, therefore, is also a jaguar lord.   And I, consequently, cannot be the blood relation of the ones I call my family.  I believe my mother is my true mother, but I cannot be the child of Tonauac. It is biologically impossible. I have grown to believe that Tonauac killed my true father -- my mother was the most beautiful of our clan and it is likely that Tonauac got rid of him in order to be able to mate with her. It is also likely that my mother helped him, as her relatives were not terribly powerful or well-respected and she was always interested in improving her lot in the world.   I discovered this fact about my genetics a number of years ago, when I was quite young. It never disturbed me greatly, but I certainly feel very little allegiance to Tonauac (and, really, my mother and brother) because of it -- a feeling which he has detected and punished me for in his cruel way, typical for a jaguar lord.   Tonauac's takeover of our clan has spawned more violent and war-mongering attitudes toward other Tabaxi and other races, particularly in the more youthful members. As humans have begun to encroach upon our clan, and many other Tabaxi clans, there is growing concern that we will lose our space forever. And nobody seems to have much interest in doing anything about this, aside from killing the humans that stray into our territory (Tonauac's approach, of course, which I have told him will only work for so long as the humans breed like rats and will overrun us quickly). I, however, have heard whisperings -- just the barest hint of myth or lore, really -- of a relic that, combined with the appropriate spell or incantation, could hide our entire island from the whole world.   And so, I've left to look for it. In my wanderings about Meztica I came upon a jaguar lord, about my age, named Xezcel (chez-kel) -- who, at the moment, has no clan but does have a fierce desire to acquire one. Consequently, I've come up with a plan: Xezcel and I will find the Hiding Relic and bring it back to Meztica, whereupon we will kill Tonauac, take over the clan, and hide the island forever. Xezcel is intensely excited about all of this. (So is Tonauac, though of course he shouldn't be. I told him what I am seeking before I left our island, and he believes I am seeking it on his behalf, to atone for my unruly behavior or some such nonsense.) I have grown to like Xezcel, but his relevance to my goal may diminish eventually depending on what other weapons and relics I can acquire throughout our travels, at which point I will have no qualms about abandoning him.   Xezcel and I have thus far searched most of Meztica with little success -- I harbored no illusions that the relic would be so close to home, but felt it necessary to be methodical about it anyway. So we have headed for colder climes, and will reach Knarvell within a fortnight.  "}]}

As a child, Pativzar grew up loving music and Milil. He always wanted to be chosen as one of Milil's champions, weather it be as a paladin or a cleric, he didn't care. He knew this dream was unlikely because Milil only ever made humans and Elves his champions. Even so, he spent his childhood trying to prove himself to Milil through prayer and song.   Though he realized Milil would probably never choose him as one of his champions, Pativzar was still dedicated to him. One way he thought that he could gain the favor of Milil was by becoming the Mayor of Milil's Ear, a position held by Adventurer's who were thought to stand for the Ideals of Milil.   The clergy of The Church of Milil were very supportive of Pativzar as he grew up. Jace Verilice, one of the High Priest's,  was always particularly kind to him. He acted as Pativzar's mentor in the church as well as the reason he was aloud into the Bard's College.   Though he was a hard studier, there were many teachers who thought that he shouldn't be in the Bard's college, because he lacked any raw talent, which they believed to be essential to becoming a Bard and would be better off becoming a  Wizard with the way he studied. However, Because of all the time and effort Pativzar put into his studies, he was able to rise to the top of the class by the time he graduated.   Second in the class actually. The top of the class was actually a different Silver Dragonborn named Ace. He, unlike Pativzar, was born with exceptionally raw talent. He was good at everything he did, from sparing, to magic, to music, he was a natural. Not only did he outperform Pativzar in everything, he was also far more liked by the rest of the school.  Pativzar was awed by Ace at first and saw him as someone to emulate. Being the only Dragonborn, his teachers would often pair them together regardless of the task. This close relationship made Pativzar realize just how much harder he needed to work to become worthy of ever being one of Milil's champions.   Their close relationship also soured his view of Ace. He came to realize that Ace wasn't the perfect person he portrays himself to be, but a naturaly gifted coward who cracks when the going gets tough. Pativzar first noticed this once when he got the upper hand in a spar and a hint of fear in Ace's eyes who backed off for a second. Though others saw it as being cunning, Pativzar knew Ace was backing off out of fear, not out of planning. Though Pativzar considered this a minor victory, Ace ultimately won the duel in the end.  After that, Pativzar was able to see this weakness in different ways when observing Ace, his adoration for Ace soured from a friendly rivalry into a bitter one where instead of striving to be like Ace, Pativzar strove to be better than Ace in every way. Though his feelings soured, he has stayed outwardly friendly to Ace  Though Pativzar never beat Ace while at the Bard College, the rivalry and constant comparison to him drove Pativzar to better himself in every way possible which lead to him finishing 2nd in the class but with a far smaller gap in their abilities, even if Ace doesn't realize just how close they are now.   Having graduated, Pativzar is ready to head out on his first adventure. Only time will tell what that will bring."}]}

Skeld is a fighter and belongs to the human race."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Skeld is the son of the Sky Pony Huntmaster, given his unusual fair hair and strong affinity to animals, his father and Chieftain, Alfhelm, both wanted him to carry on in his family tradition as the Huntmaster, but Skeld had other ideas. After his coming of age initiation, he chose to work towards becoming part of the Chieftains bodyguards. To everyone’s surprise, he passed the initiation and became the newest hopeful recruit for the Skywardens.  Still too young and inexperienced to have quested for his own Pegasus, his daily tasks involved guarding the Chieftains wife, infant son and daughter, Morwenna. This was when he first fell in love. Morwenna and he were the same age, and they both had a love of animals, Skeld just needed to impress her and her father enough to allow them to wed. A journey to the One Stone in the Moonwood, could be the perfect way to show off his skills, so he arranged to be part of the escort for the Shaman Blackhoof, his son Gunnleif, Morwenna and her mother.  Little did he know that the Lycanthrope tribe of Claw Hollow had moved into the area, and had paid Blackhoof to bring the Chiefs family for sacrifice to them, rather than going to the One Stone for blessings. The ambush was fast, Skeld managed to get Morwenna, her mother, Hildegard and Gunnleif galloping through a gap during the fight. The chase was intense, with three powerful Lycanthropes in hot pursuit, Hildergart and Morwenna’s long limbed warhorses were having no problem, but being the youngest Skeld only had a tough Uthgardt pony to ride and started to fall behind.  He never saw the Werewolf that took him from his horse, his shield and pony took most of the blow, turning into kindling and meat respectively. He hit one of the many standing stones, fortune smiling on him as he slid into a hollow near its base, and the pony fell across the opening. There he lay for many hours, unconscious and bleeding. When he finally awoke and woozily pushed his way out, it was night. Following the trail that Morwenna, Hildergart and the other Warden’s horses had left, he came upon a grizzly scene, two of the horses were dead next to claw marks and a large puddle of blood surrounding what looked like human guts. Of the two woman and the Skywarden, there was no other trace.  Only Morwennas black Uthgardt warhorse remained unharmed, caught in some briars a short distance away. Skeld managed to disentangle the horse and haul himself into the saddle before blacking out once more.  It was many days later when he awoke once more, in a tree hut owned by a Wood elf ranger. The ranger introduced themselves as Taurandir, he had witnessed the battle, and the small groups flight from the Lycans. He had also seen what had happened after Skeld had been knocked off his horse. It was grim news. The Lycans had cornered Hildegard, Morwenna and Gunnleif, killing the two horses and nearly eviscerating Gunnleif. But then Bloodhoof had arrived, an argument had ensued and they had been led away into the forest. Taurandir had wanted to be sure Skeld would not turn before he offered aid, he had been impressed at the Uthgardt's tenacity in spite of his injury. That was when Skeld realised his head was shaved and bandaged, stitches and herbalism had saved his life, but it had not left him unmarked. He wanted to pursue the Claw Hollow Lycans immediately, hoping to rescue Morwenna and her mother, Taurandir managed to persuade him to stay and recover before marching to certain death.   Another three days passed, Skeld regained his strength and formed a plan. He would return to the village, gather the Skywardens and the Chief, lead them to the forest and Taurandir would help track the Lycans.  However; upon returning to the village his world collapsed around him. Bloodhoof saw him before he could enter the great hall, screaming accusations he rushed forward, demanding the Skeld's arrest. The guards nearby leapt to obey, hauling the surprised youth into the Great Hall before the chief, but it was not Chief Alfhelm sat on the Great seat, but Chief Gunnleif!  Horrified Skeld stood open mouthed as Gunnleif and Bloodhoof recounted a heavily altered version of the events, accusing Skeld of organising the ambush with the Claw Hollow Lycanthropes. In a daze, he was led away to the stockade.  That night Taurandir broke him out, the elf had seen them leading him away in chains and assumed the worst. Enflamed with thoughts of vengeance Skeld vowed to return one day to clear his name, rescue Morwenna and kill his accusers.  "}]}

The cult believes the tieflings’ “curse” can be eradicated through centuries of devotion down the bloodlines and intermarrying with humans. For some in the cult, this devotion takes the form of monastic combat training and harnessing of one’s ki. They were never a perfect student, but developed their skills well within the context of the cult. For most tieflings in the cult, including Alacrity and their sister Penitence, devotion also means marrying and having a child with a human. The pressure is even greater for them, because by the reckoning of the cult, their bloodline should be purified enough that any children either of them have with a human should be a human rather than a tiefling. When Alacrity is 22, Penitence gives birth to her first child. When the infant is discovered to be a tiefling, Penitence is killed, in accordance with the cult’s rules (her husband is imprisoned and the child disappears). Alacrity, furious and terrified, flees the cult at once. With no experience of life outside the cult, Alacrity struggles to find a place for themself in the major city in which they wash up. To make matters worse, in the wake of their shattered faith, they’ve lost control of their ki abilities. After bumming around for a while, a lost and rain-soaked Alacrity meets Corbett, a half-elf. Corbett takes them home and gives them a place to stay. Alacrity is icy at first, being a negative person by nature, and not liking the vulnerable position they’re in. Corbett is a perfect gentleman, never for a moment expressing sexual interest in his new roommate. With time, things change. Corbett works with the underserved people of the city, doing whatever needs doing and advocating for folks who find themselves in legal trouble. He also knows a little bit of healing magic, and can help people with minor injuries and illnesses. Alacrity soon joins him on these visits, helping where they can, and slowly finding their footing in the outside world. Slowly, too, Alacrity and Corbett fall in love. They have years together. They live a meager, marginalized life in the big city, but they’re happy with each other. Mostly, that is. A wedge that was there from the start eventually drives between them: Alacrity’s past. Alacrity can’t bear to speak to Corbett about the cult, and about the trauma they suffered throughout their youth, and on that final day when Penitence died. The secrets stop Alacrity from being as open and vulnerable as love requires, and silences turn to snaps turn to arguments with no resolution. One day, Alacrity leaves. They move to a different part of the city, just as impoverished, and spend weeks in misery and intoxicants. They surface from the bender one morning to a bright flash of light, and a heavy voice begins speaking to them. The voice belongs to Emizah, the goddess worshipped by the cult Alacrity grew up in. Only, Emizah says, they don’t truly worship her at all. Emizah has no strictures about purity that can “cleanse” tieflings. In fact, the nature of the cult is abhorrent to her. She values all life above any other concern, whether human or tiefling or anything else. That the cult has been killing people in her name is a blasphemy of the highest order. Unfortunately, she has lost her ability to act directly on the material plane, and can’t personally do anything to stop them. Instead, she recruits people to her cause, and to devotion to her. In return, she gives them divine power. Alacrity is immediately resistant, telling her to fuck right off. What do they owe her? They don’t want anything except some peace and quiet to succumb to their depression in. But Emizah knows what Alacrity went through, and she knows how deeply their hatred for the cult runs. She entices them with one last request: in exchange for divine magic, Alacrity will personally take down the people that killed their sister. Alacrity agrees. For years, they take up the mantle of a wandering healer, though they keep the source of their power obscure. Alacrity has no desire to be seen as associated with the cult, the only people who worship Emizah openly, and so dodges questions that get too close to the secret. All the while, Emizah occasionally directs them to perform tasks that, she swears, will bring Alacrity closer to their revenge. Eventually, at the age of 30, they are recruited to act as medic on an inter-planar ship."}]}

But she is also the eldest of seven, very much your overbearing older sibling, and constantly, annoyingly, right.    She joined the local militia to get out of the farming community where her family lives, and where she had been more or less parenting her younger brothers.  Rowan had always been gifted horsewoman, and turned out to be equally gifted in the cavalry.  She loved it, and would have stayed, save the fact she didn't make friends so well.  Turns out, being predisposed to bossiness, being a little too over prepared, and having the literal terrain on her side, with a helping of supernatural strength and sight, didn't make her popular.  Reliable in battle, and possessed of the spine to do the right thing in difficult circumstances, she was very good at her job, however, when she tried to buy commission into the regular, standing army, she was summarily denied, and sent back home.    Rowan decided she was having none of that.  She packed up her gear and started for the nearest major city, to talk with higher placed officers directly.  They still weren't having it, so she sold her horse, and booked passage to another continent.  On the ship, she had the very ill-luck to fall in with a group of, let's say...vagrants, who have put her on the outs with the law.  On the one hand, she's currently got a bounty on her head for one that no good Steven killing a guard she was standing next to, on the other, these idiots literally couldn't keep themselves alive if she wasn't bringing her shield up in their defense and she can't have their deaths on her conscience.  And they're not all bad, Maplefist is a nice enough sort.  Even if he is like a...7 foot tall toddler lumberjack in a loincloth.    So, basically, she's right back playing put-upon older sister to a bunch of miscreants, but it has meant she's sleeping under the stars, and has become much more at peace with her own, natural affinity for green places and animals.  And it doesn't hurt that she can now literally call down thunder from the sky, that's pretty fun, she won't lie.    Rowan is a little stodgy, and tends to overthink things, but means well, and feels responsible for those around her.  Even if she is kind of a know it all, she does stick her neck out for the people she feels responsible for, even if it comes at personal cost.   "}]}

The nights of her early life were filled with starry skies from horizon to horizon, and days full herding and learning from the priestess of her tribe. Her easy nature and natural curiosity made her eager to learn the ways of their goddess, Mishakal, and, as she bloomed from youth into maidenhood, she begged her family allow her to leave the tribe to seek the Holy Order of the Stars for further instruction in the path of restoration and light.      The stories of Goldmoon and Riverwind fueled her fantasies of a romance and adventure she could only dream of experiencing. Naturally optimistic, and full of the desire for a life beyond the flock, she joined the Holy Order, spending her first three years working hard to attain the peace and discipline needed to heal the body of another while learning languages and lore.       It did not come easily. Boisterous, and too often unable to keep her mind from wandering in fanciful directions, she struggled with a wanderlust borne of a nomadic past. She craved the knowledge offered by the Order, but fought the need to roam, the need for freedom under diamond studded skies. After attaining the restraint and control needed to perform a couple spells of minor healing, a fellow acolyte and sometime object of unrequited affection, Errai, invited her to sneak away into the night. She followed him with little cajoling into the wilds surrounding the compound. Her heart bursting with an innocent love, and the desire for freedom always burning in the back of her consciousness, they stole away for a few glorious hours, returning just before the new day broke.      A single carefree night quickly became a reckless addiction. The few times they were discovered, they were forgiven, but cautioned strongly against such foolhardiness. The surrounding forests were dangerous, full of thieves and evil creatures.      Her love for Errai grew stronger with every evening spent away from the cloisters of the Holy Order, blossoming from sweet infatuation, to pure devotion. Errai, however seemed never to see her as more than a dear friend and confidant. A few years ahead in his own training, he had not much longer before his time was complete and he would strike out on his own. His heart seemed not to belong within the walls and safety of the place, and one night, during one of their unsanctioned excursions, Errai informed Zavijava he would be leaving for Waterdeep on the following morning. He had received a missive from his brother earlier that day, seeking aid in an endeavor at sea. He would return sometime… if he did not find his fortune and the life he craved on the open waters.      Overcome with loss and unsure how to behave in the face of losing the man who was so important to her, Zeevee simply kissed Errai tenderly upon the cheek, praying the benevolent Light Bringer smiled upon him, and together they watched the sky in silence until the first rays of morning crested the treetops.       The next morning, he was gone. She fled the stifling good will of those who would offer her condolences, those who were not him no matter how they smiled and bid her look to brighter days, as the emptiness burned in her breast like poison, leeching the light from the once-beloved stars, and making the perfectly full moon seem a pale imitation of heavenly perfection.      She shuffled down the paths, so often run hand-in-hand, alone, unseeing and uncaring whither they led. She heeded not the scents of blood, saw none of the broken branches, and heard none of the sounds of distress in the wood. She was alone.      When the growls of the unseen beast finally registered in her mind, only a second passed before she felt the flesh at the base of her neck giving way beneath strong jaws. The animal retreated before it had done enough damage to do more than make her scream in pain and spin to face her attacker. Weaponless and alone, she trembled as she looked upon it.      The animal was vaguely humanoid in shape, but grotesque, with haunting yellow eyes surrounded by demonic black sclera, and a maw filled with bloodstained teeth. A moment of giddy realization told her that was her blood. Fur covered its body in wiry grey tufts, and it sniffed the air as if testing the air to suss out her next move. It was on her again before she could blink. She was sure it spelled her death, but the creature merely seized her by the neck in one clawed hand and slammed her head into the tree she’d backed against, where the world around her went black.      When she regained consciousness, she believed herself dead. A few foundering moments of sorting through the pain radiating from the junction between her neck and shoulder dispelled the notion as the dead surely couldn’t feel pain, but she was sure she was blind, so deep was the inky darkness. Cold stone and dirt beneath her fingers brought reality closer into focus, and the truth of her plight followed on its heels.       Determination to survive roared to life within her.      Feeling along the ground, she found a pile of furs, and a dead… something… a rabbit, and a little farther in, a wooden pail half full of odorless liquid. She gulped it down greedily, her soiled hand tainting the flavor with grit and the harsh, metallic taste of blood. Her left shoulder throbbed mercilessly, but she dragged herself along the floor as she tried to feel her way out of the disorienting blackness.      Her captor returned before she even caught a hint of light that might give her hope of escape, however, and dragged her back to the place where the furs were piled. She screamed, begged him for mercy. Promised rewards she could never hope to deliver if he’d only let her go. He gave her no reply to any of her entreaties, only shoved the rabbit at her before leaving again, his fading footsteps the only indicator he was no longer there. Upon his next return, he found her trying to crawl away from the darkness once again. Once again, he unceremoniously deposited her back on the musty furs, before taking hold of her hair and yanking her head to the side and settling behind her. She cried out in pain and frustration at the rough handling, tears sliding down her cheeks in salty rivers. Still he refused to speak.      Instead, he tore her tunic from the crusted wound. She screamed again in pain and mortification as she felt a wide tongue begin to lave at the just-scabbing punctures. Trying futilely to break away, she wept, called for his mercy and that of her goddess, but none came. When he finished the inexplicable behavior, he stood, tossed the now stiff rabbit into her lap once again, and left her alone. She heaved the dead thing away from herself, not hearing it hit any walls, and wept herself into exhaustion.       Time was measured in attempts at flight and her subsequent return to her cell with no bars, the return of her captor, and dead things thrust upon her. She ate them raw, hunger eventually winning the internal war with revulsion. Her injury healed, her spirit did not. How often had she begged her Goddess for absolution, and none came? How had she failed? Why was she being punished? What new horror awaited her just beyond this? How would she ever escape?        Her captor seemed to know when she attempted to flee. He would let her try, but no matter what she tried, running, crawling, sliding along walls, he always brought her back before she ever saw the light of day. He had licked her wound several times before it had healed as well, but never spoke to her, never did more than bring her freshly killed animals that she was forced to rip into, fur and all, with her nails and teeth.      And then one day, he did not come.      He did not bring her an animal that she had to choke through fur and sinew and warm blood.      A day came when she met no one barring her departure from the cold confines of the cave’s blackness.      A day, or night rather, came when moonlight greeted her, promising salvation.      She stepped into it, not fully trusting that she would not be collected any moment and, perhaps, this time punished for daring to allow the moonlight to bather her gaunt features. It was harsh and bright to her ill-adjusted eyes, and she shrank back into the shadows before gathering her courage to run until she no longer possessed the strength.       Stepping fully into the forest, her heart threatened to beat through its cage.       A howl went up to her left as the clouds shrouding the full moon parted.      Zavijava took one last look at it before running, but pain sent ther crashing to the forest floor. Her bones felt like they were snapping all at once. While hot fire consumed every nerve ending. A guttural snarl ripped from her throat when she tried to scream.      And she knew.      The moonlight had not delivered her into salvation, no. It had borne her into hell.      Too late to return to her life…      Too late for a cure.      "}]}

Though his father loved his great grandpa, even he finds the name almost impossible to pronounce, so everyone, even elves, pretty much calls Aphglirvorien by his last name, Smith.  Smith learned a number of things during his upbringing: certain hunting skills, a tolerance of all other races (as everyone had to work together to keep the community going), and a few of the languages that were in common use in the town.  He also discovered that he didn't have the patience required to be a good hunter-gatherer.  So, when he came of age, he and his family had a talk, and they decided that he was probably better suited for the life of an itinerant adventurer.  With his family's blessing, and a few silver pieces they scraped together, he headed out into the world with the next passing trader.  Since then, he's wandered the civilized lands, seldom staying in a single place for long, and he's picked up some skills along the way.  Notably, he stayed with a wizard for a short while, and got an interest in magic, and a few magical secrets, from her.  He tries to visit his parents at least once every couple of years, and sends them presents and useful supplies when he can, and letters when he has some downtime."}]}

He was basically a common thief, living on the outskirts of towns, stealing what he needed to survive, moving to the next town when people got suspicious...all of which clever-but-not-particularly- wise Pim accepted as a way of life, and quickly learned to emulate.  He filled her head with stories of \"her\" lost kingdom, The Seven Shires, when she was young, and gave her an amulet representing her lineage on her eleventh birthday -- a lucky year according to halfling lore.  (He even referred to her fondly as \"your majesty\".)  He disappeared shortly thereafter during a \"food gathering\" mission, but Pim (who was left behind to guard the camp) never found out what happened to him, and though she has no evidence, will swear that he's still alive and that they'll be reunited someday.  In any case, Pim was left to fend for herself.  Whether the halfling's stories are true, and whether the amulet itself is anything more than a pilfered trinket are unanswered questions, but Pim wholeheartedly believes every last word of it.  When she gets the chance, she tries to find (or \"borrow\") books of history and lore in an attempt to learn more about her kingdom, which she has sworn to reestablish -- or perish in the attempt.  She doesn't like to carry more than a day's supply of food and water, so she rarely ventures into the wilderness.  She depends on others (townsfolk when in town; passing travelers on the road) to provide what she needs.  When she gets hungry, she'll (in order of descending preference) thieve, charm, or (as a last resort) physically harm to get what she needs.  She can very effectively ambush a victim by hiding in the shadows and firing a single deadly shot with her bow.  She's even hired herself out as a mercenary on occasion...but in general, she's not fond of killing innocent people and will only resort to violence if she can find some way to justify it to herself.  Being clever, she's good at coming up with justifications when she needs to.  In Myers-Briggs terms, she's:  XNTJ A little paranoid of strangers, but not a bad leader; bright, but sometimes has her head in the clouds; clever and inventive, but short-tempered; has a definite sense of right and wrong, but it's firmly rooted in her own values, not anyone else's...and she's always happy to impose those values on whomever is around her.  Definitely anti-authoritarian, particularly because she knows she's always right."}]}

This character is a half-elf ranger."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Vic was born into a small band of woodsfolk, the only child of his human father and wood-elf mother. His father, Thohorn, was raised in the tribe, trained in the ways of the woods and the hunt. His mother, Therlynn, had run away from her wealthy urban family in order to be closer to nature and enhance her druidic powers. Eventually her path crossed with the tribe's and after overcoming a grueling trial she was asked to join and agreed. Very few outsiders joined the tribe and generally marriages were arranged, Thohorn was to marry one of the daughters of the chief, that is until he fell in love with Therlynn. It wasn't the first time a betrothal was called off but the chief was noticeably offended.   Although Thohorn was as skilled as the best hunters in the tribe he was given some of the worst jobs and was sent to the far reaches of tribes hunting grounds in order to scout very frequently, Therlynn almost always accompanied him. Th`````````````````````````````````````e couple was happy and after a few years they welcomed Vicgretor to the family. The forest was bountiful during Vic's early life and the tribe was doing very well, only moving every few months to new hunting grounds. The old chief died and his eldest son who was a fair and just man took over. Vic followed his father everywhere, learning the ways of the wood and the wild as well as the bow and the blade. His mother's influences weren't entirely lost on him but Vic's connection to nature was more physical than mystical. When Vic was twenty he was tasked with building his own longbow and setting out to find and slay a dangerous lone wolf that had been taking more than its share of game. Vic spent two days crafting a sturdy longbow and some flint arrows before setting out towards the wolf's territory, he quickly found tracks that eventually led him to the wolf's den. As Vic slowly approached the opening he caught sight of motion at the corner of his vision and turned just in time to see the wolf leap at him. The vicious teeth narrowly missed Vic's throat as he shoved the beast off, pulled back his bow and sent an arrow straight into the wolf's eye. Vic skinned the wolf, pried out the canine teeth, and then burned the rest of the foul beast. Vic returned to the tribe as the hunter of the wolf, a small celebration was held with the few family friends invited.   After fifteen more years of life in the wild the tribe found that hunting was getting harder, more land was being claimed by the city people, forests cut down, beasts slain indiscriminately. Vic's mother Therlynn was slain by a direwolf while Thohorn and Vic were away on a hunt, Thohorn stoically buried his wife as Vic wept endless tears. When day broke the pair tracked the direwolf some distance but a sudden rainstorm washed away the trail. In the years soon after his mother's death Vic spent most of his time alone in the far reaches of the forest. Thohorn grew older rapidly and went on very few hunts, he died in his sleep the winter before Vic's 47th birthday. The tribe was struggling and a few families left in search of more fruitful hunting grounds. Vic continued to spend most of his time alone deep in the wilderness, until he encountered a dwarven hunter named Horkas. Horkas had come down from the mountains into the Reaching Woods to slay great beasts for sport and trophies, Vic instantly knew his intent as he had encountered many similar hunters in the past. Vic stalked the Dwarf as the Dwarf stalked some sort of beast, Vic was too intent on the trespasser. On the second morning the Dwarf had caught up to his quarry and prepared himself for a fight, creeping forward into a small clearing the Dwarf raised his crossbow and fired. Vic was too far behind to see what the target was but it quickly came into view, a great black dire wolf. Vic felt like he shot 20 arrows into the beast before it finally fell, the stout dwarf was seriously wounded but delivered the killing blow. When Vic approached the Dwarf he introduced himself as Horkas the Hunter and then passed out, Vic managed to stop the bleeding and use a blend of herbs to bring back enough strength in Horkas so he could travel.   As they slowly traveled to a town which Horkas said was nearby, Vic did what he could to persuade the Dwarf to show a greater respect towards nature, although they both agreed that the dire wolf needed to die. They arrived in the small town and found a healer to attend to Horkas, Vic had visited towns before but never for an extended period, as every hour passed his restlessness grew. The healer informed Vic that his dwarven friend needed to rest and guided them to an inn. Horkas gave Vic a small coin purse to pay for the room and food, as Vic awkwardly talked to the barkeep about the absurdity of paying to sleep somewhere he slammed down 5 gold pieces and said this better be worth it. Because the room only cost 2 gold and the barkeep was somewhat frightened by the wild looking half-elf, he yelled for a waitress to bring food and he poured a large mug of beer. Vic had never tasted anything more delicious and as he finished the second mug he was feeling much less restless. Horkas took two days to recover and Vic spent most of it in various states of intoxication. Horkas had a short list of other dangerous beasts in the area and suggested that Vic aid him in dispatching them. They traveled together for six years hunting dangerous beasts until Horkas received a message calling him back to his home in the mountains. Vic had spent more and more time away from the tribe and when he made his way to the spring hunting grounds only a few families remained. The chief had died and his successor was mostly incompetent and somewhat lazy, he took his family and settled in a small city. After that many other groups went north to find more remote wilderness and better hunting. Vic took to the coastal road, guiding travelers for a few coins and then spending it all drinking when in a town or city. A few years go by and he made his way north passed Waterdeep and on to Neverwinter, he has heard talk of forest land being sold in large parcels and wishes to make some serious coin. He encountered a flamboyantly dressed man who introduced himself as Percival, you can call me Percy, Haunt. Vic offered his service as a guide and Percival agreed.  "}]}

From down on the bottom rung of the social ladder, he developed a sense of right and wrong skewed to fit a world where many had to steal or kill to survive.  The first time Galin killed, he was ten. A wealthy man was beating a beggar just because she asked for coin. Galin knifed him in the back. He found he strangely satisfied with his handiwork. It was a form of justice that fitted his view of the world.  At the age of twelve, Galin was singing for coin on a street corner and caught the ear of a local minstrel, who offered to train the boy. While he no longer lived on the streets, Galin still worked on them for his living and kept up with his contacts and occasional work for the criminal underworld.  It was during this time that a strange voice spoke to Galin, seeming to come from the music as he played his lute. As his music improved, so did his connection to this mysterious entity. Intrigued by the being's offers of magical powers, Galin made a pact. He knew better than to overuse his new-found powers, but every now and then he would use his powers to improve his juggling performances – awing his audiences who believed it to be a trick.  When he was twenty, Galin had developed enough of a reputation that he was invited to perform in courts. At this time, a noble had started an aggressive campaign against the criminal class. One of Galin's old friends approached him, figuring he could get close enough to the noble to kill him. Galin accepted to contract on the condition that his identity remain secret – he didn't want it to ruin his performing career. The two agreed that if anyone asked, they would say the contract had been carried out by the Alabaster Assassin – named for the alabaster mask Galin had found when he was young.  Galin killed the man in the middle of a party, with a knife subtly thrown while he was juggling. He got away clean. After that, the criminal underworld was abuzz with the name Alabaster Assassin. Rumors reached the streets and messages in thieves' cant offered Galin money he couldn't ignore. Concealing himself with a cloak, white gloves and his alabaster mask, Galin arranged meetings and took a few contracts that suited his abilities.  It was on the third such contract that Galin, now twenty one, began to question himself. The target was a girl who frequented the court parties. She was actually an avid fan of his – so much so that she had given him a lock of her hair. He had stabbed her as she twirled past on the dance floor, then quickly cleaned the murder weapon with his magic. As she died, oblivious of who had killed her, she stumbled over to him. Her last words were, “I love you.” No one had ever said that to him before.  Galin was torn apart. He spent months quietly researching, finding out why he had killed her, only to find out she had looked at someone's husband the wrong way. Infuriated with himself, Galin vowed he would never take an unjust contract again. He could no longer bear to stay in [King's Gate], though. He took his show on the road.  While he lived mostly from his performing, Galin still took the occasional contract. Upon arriving in a new town, he would deliver tokens of the Alabaster Assassin – temporarily disguised as copper coins – to carefully chosen beggars. Soon enough, messages would crop up with contracts. He picked the ones he accepted very carefully now.  He still managed to make a mistake, once. However, when he realized his target was innocent, Galin helped fake the man's death and set him up in a new town with a new identity. Even though his conscience was clear, he still felt guilty that he had taken money for a kill he never performed. Plus he was afraid someone might find out he had defaulted on a contract, not only ruining his secondary career, but also making him a prime target if anyone discovered his true identity. But any time his guilt, doubt and fear seemed to close around him, all Galin had to do was pull out that lock of hair and he knew that he'd done the right thing."}]}

He is a human druid."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Renvor was born in a small barbarian village in the region near Tiyerna. He lived a simple life, growing up with his parents teaching him the ways of the land – to worship the natural spirits and respect the animals, even those they hunted. He was curious and eager to learn. He wanted to know everything. It was a happy childhood, filled with the gruff love of his people.  Then, at the age of nine, Renvor's life changed. Something was happening to the villagers – they seemed to be going mad. Renvor was too young to truly understand, all he knew for certain was that people were acting strange. His parents were acting strange.  One day, after Renvor fetched water from the village well – where he had lingered to play with a visiting cleric of Tarhun, whom he was fond of because she was an adult as short as he was – his parents took him out hunting. While out in the jungle, stalking their prey, Renvor heard his mother scream. He spun to help her, only to find her pointing at him, a look of terror on her face.  Renvor tried to understand what was going on, tried to reassure his terrified mother. Then he saw his father, off in in the brush, his bow raised. But, where was the arrow?  He found out a moment later when it thudded into his shoulder, spinning him in a full circle. He opened his mouth to ask what was happening, only to see his mother charging at him, knife raised. In that moment, he understood that his parents intended to kill him.  With no other options, he fled. Even as he did so, he knew it was hopeless. His parents could outrun him and, even if they couldn't, they could easily track him by the blood leaking from his shoulder. So, he did the only thing he could think to do. He begged the spirits of the jungle to save him from his murderous parents.  He felt a strange energy flow through him – bringing with it a calmness and connection to nature he had never felt before. He glanced over his shoulder just in time to see vines reaching up from the ground to hinder his parents. He couldn't believe his eyes! He had heard stories about such miracles, but he thought they were fairytales.  He continued running, but was still concerned about his parents following his blood trail – until he realized the arrow was no longer in his shoulder and the wound had closed. Marveling at his luck, Renvor became more careful as he moved on, using every trick he knew to hide his trail. He vanished into the jungle and hid until nightfall.  Late in the night, he snuck back to the village. On the outskirts, he came across a strange gathering of people, their faces painted all black as they performed some strange, mad ceremony. He navigated around them and went home – wondering if he would be welcome. Peeking in a window, he saw his parents eating from empty plates, but otherwise looking normal and peaceful. Yet, at the sight of them, his stomach churned – how could they be so calm after trying to murder him? - and he fled back into the jungle.  There, he found his peace again. He'd always enjoyed being out in the wilderness. He'd always felt more connected with nature than with the people of his village, except his parents, of course. Now, he decided he didn't need any of them. People. Villages. Houses. Walls. Nothing. He had called to the natural world for help, and he had been saved.   He found a suitable place to make camp, then meditated, communing with the spirits. He thought he could feel a connection that hadn't been there before, like the one he'd felt while fleeing from his parents. Comforted, he went to sleep feeling safe.  Over the next several months, he wandered through the wilderness – swamps, jungles, plains, whatever he came upon – living off the land, connecting to the plants and animals in ways he never had before, experimenting with his new skills and, every night, communing with the spirits. Before long, he found he could even turn himself into a beast, and he delighted in running with packs of wolves or stalking his dinner as a panther.  One night, shortly after his tenth birthday, while hopping around as a frog, he came across a campfire. It had been a long time since he'd last interacted with another person and, as always, he was too curious not to investigate. It was only a couple of travelers, but to Renvor's shock, they were speaking of his home! Apparently, some evil cult called the Crawling Chaos had been poisoning the water to turn the whole village mad. Then Zaela Thunderstruck, a diminutive whip-wielding cleric of Tarhun, had discovered the plot, revealed it, and led an attack that drove the cultists away.  Suddenly, his parents' attack on him made sense. If the madness was cured, was it safe for him to go home? Renvor wasn't sure how he felt about that – he did so love living out in the wild, surrounded by animals and spirits – but he had to know. So, he headed for home.  After weeks of travel he found himself, in the guise of a cat, looking upon the house he had grown up in. He hopped up onto the windowsill and stared in. There were his parents. He felt a stab of fear, his memory flashing back to their last family hunting trip. But he contained it, assuring himself that his parents were sane again.  He was just about to hop down and go to the door when his mother walked into view. She was holding a baby. She and his father cooed over it, obviously delighted. As if Renvor had never existed. In that moment, he knew his parents had replaced him. This was no longer his home.  That was okay, he reflected, as he returned to the natural world. They had been replaced, too. He had the animals and plants and spirits now. He didn't need them anymore.  Before he left town, though, he found a sweet that someone had dropped. It served as a reminder to him that there were still some things worthwhile in civilized parts.  He was also intrigued by this Zaela cleric. He was fairly certain she was the visiting one he had met a few times. He felt like, for some reason, he should thank her if he could. For, although his family had forsaken him, she had still saved them – and they were, after all, his parents. If he happened to run into her, he would express his gratitude.  Renvor took to the wilds again, wandering and further exploring his skills. But now his wanderings had a vague direction – following rumors of Zaela Thunderstruck. It wasn't, by any means, a frantic search. He simply had nowhere better to go, so he followed her trail when he could.  Occasionally he would stop by a town or village, often as a dog begging for foods he couldn't prepare himself, sometimes as himself. He traded his skills and, sometimes, his magic for tools and equipment. Sometimes he was welcomed. Sometimes he was driven off. He was most often driven off when someone decided to adopt him when he was in animal form, then he accidentally fell asleep while cuddling with them. His new owners were always displeased to awake cuddling a dirty little boy instead of the cute doggy the had found, and he was lucky to escape with his life. Yet, for all the trouble, it was a mistake he made remarkably often – the comfort of human contact was too appealing and he kept telling himself that this time he would stay awake and sneak off in the night.  After two years of wandering, improving his skills, and following rumors about tiny clerics, twelve-year-old Renvor arrived at the city of Droum. It was a huge, terrifying place, but rumor said Zaela Thunderstruck was recently there. Renvor had avoided the big cities up until now, but he steeled himself to go in. Besides finally being able to thank Zaela for saving his village, he was curious. What was a city like?"}]}

This halfling cleric possesses exceptional healing abilities and unwavering devotion to their deity. Remember to encapsulate their unique personality, motivations, and experiences in a concise manner."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Zaela grew up in the Sussurian Jungle where her tribe lived. They kept to themselves, as halflings do, and defended their territories when necessary, worshiping the spirits.  Zaela was a determined young halfling, always pouring her full effort into everything she did. She enjoyed her life and was particularly fond of hunting.  One day, when she was eighteen, her tribe burst into chaos. There was a large party of outsiders traversing the jungle – too many to fight. Many were worried that their village would be discovered, so they all packed up and melted into the woods.  But Zaela was curious. Who were these outsiders? What were they like? And why did her fierce people fear them?  She wasn't the only curious one. Most of the young halflings were unsure of why they were hiding, so it was easy to convince her friend Yew to sneak off with her.  They easily found the large caravan. It was cutting its way through the jungle, following a hunting track and leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. The pair sat in a tree, ignoring the rain, watching in wonder. The most astounding thing to Zaela were the people. They were giants! So many of them, nearly twice the height of anyone she had ever met!  Ignoring Yew's protests, Zaela leaned out of her tree to get a better look – and slipped. Somehow she managed to land unharmed, accompanied by a peal of thunder from the sky. But there was a problem – she was surrounded by the outsiders.  She was caught in the middle of the hunting track. She looked round and she knew there was no turning back. Her mind raced and she thought, what could she do? And she knew there was no help, no help from Yew.  With the sound of drums beating in her heart and thunder in the clouds overhead, Zaela tore towards the trees. From the shouts behind her, she knew she was being followed. Stooping, she snatched up a vine from the ground and spun, snapping it out like a whip to trip up the closest giant – but there were two more not far behind.  There was one tall tree standing further into the track than the others – somehow it had escaped the destruction. The moment she reached it, Zaela scampered up. When she was halfway up the tree, she risked a glance down. There were two of those giants – one standing on either side of the tree looking up at her.  That's when it happened. With a deafening roar of thunder, a bolt of lightning arced down out of the sky. Splitting into three forks – striking both of the giants and Zaela.  Zaela forever remembered the smell of singed hair. Her ears were ringing and she felt all tingly and woozy. She didn't remember falling, but she remembered the impact of hitting the muddy ground. She remembered thinking there should have been a squelchy sound, but all she could hear was that ringing in her ears.  Then there were giants looming over, moving their lips. She strained to hear and understand them until she heard a muffled voice say, “The other two are dead, but Tarhun has spared the child.”  “No,” a deep voice said, and a bearded face appeared above Zaela, jostling the others aside. “Tarhun has chosen her.”  Zaela must have blacked out after that. She vaguely recalled opening her eyes and looking up at a moving sky while the world jumped and bounced uncomfortably below her. But she didn't remember anything much until she woke up in the small temple of Tarhun in Menamb.  She was greeted by the bearded man she had seen after her fall. He introduced himself as Harmen, cleric of Tarhun. Curious in spite of her fear, Zaela listened to what this 'human' told her about his 'god'. It all seemed odd and mildly humerus to to the young halfling. Clearly these outsiders could benefit from education about the spirits of the natural world. Still, she listened respectfully, as he was her elder.  After telling her much about Tarhun, Harmen dubbed her Zaela Thunderstruck – obviously a favored of this most powerful of gods, as Tarhun had spared her – a child – when his holy lightning bolt had killed two full grown, strong men. Zaela liked the sound of that.  As much as she liked this man – even though he thought she was far younger than she was – and she had a curiosity that could never be sated, Zaela knew she couldn't stay here with the man. Her family would be worried about her. So, she left the temple and returned to the jungle. She was worried about finding her way home, but she was met by her tribe not far outside of Menamb. Yew had told them of what had happened and they came to rescue her.  After a sound thrashing for the stunt she'd pulled, life went back to normal for the halflings. Yet, something had changed in Zaela. She didn't know what it was, but she felt an emptiness inside her. She found herself scoffing at the rituals to worship the puny spirits when she knew there was a great god like Tarhun out there.  So, she started sneaking off on 'hunting trips' to visit Harmen in Menamb. The old man was delighted in her interest and how well this 'child' soaked up information. Finally, Zaela told him the truth of her identity.  Harmen thought it was a great laugh that he'd thought her a young child all this time. By human standards, she was already an adult – even though her people wouldn't consider her one for another two years. From that day on, Harmen began mentoring Zaela.  Over the next two years, Zaela spent as much time as she dared with the old human. Back at home with her people, the divide grew. She'd started telling her peers about Tarhun. The shamans were not amused. However, she was a child and none of the others seemed inclined to follow her blasphemy, so her behavior was tollerated.  Then, a few months after Zaela had turned twenty, Harmen joined with a party of people on their way to stamp out a group of the Cult of the Crawling Chaos who had set up shop nearby. Zaela Thunderstruck was invited along to observe, be a lucky charm, and help in her limited capacity.  The mission was a disaster. The party found the Cult, faces painted black as they danced around, performing some ritual. Zaela had been forbidden from joining in the battle, so she watched, confident in her master and the power of Tarhun. At first, the battle had gone well – then, out of nowhere, some horrible, shadowy tentacle-thing joined in. Some of the party members went mad at the mere sight of it. Others fought on, to no avail. Harmen was the last to fall – a powerful prayer to Tarhun halfway from his lips when a tentacle batted his head from his shoulders.  The head rolled to land at Zaela's hairy feet. She turned and fled, shaking at the knees. She ran all night and the next day, only stopping when she collapsed at home.  From then on, there was no more sneaking off to learn about her god. But what she had seen that night had showed her something – it taught her why it was so important to have a god as powerful as Tarhun. If the evil Cult of the Crawling Chaos could summon such a being as the hideous one she'd seen, what chance did mere spirits possess?  Zaela Thunderstruck became zealous in her worship of Tarhun. She also became more vocal, spreading the word of her god to any halfling who would listen. She pressed and pressed them to convert, warning of the evils out in the world, until finally the tribe could take no more.  Zaela was cast from her tribe and banished from their lands. Alone in the wilderness, with few supplies, Zaela wandered. She often found herself repeating to herself that everything was alright; she was doing fine. But she couldn't deny that the loss of her family and her people broke her heart – especially because she knew the dangers they could face without her and Tarhun to help.  She fashioned herself a makeshift shield and a whip from a vine. She kept moving forward, with no idea of where she was going. In the first village she found herself in, she managed to get a proper whip – she loved the weapon for the crack it made; like the thunder of Tarhun. She also learned what she could of her god from the locals, but she didn't stay long – the locals here also grew tired of her zealotry.  For the next three years, Zaela wandered from settlement to settlement, learning what she could of her god and moving on – always an outcast, always lonely. Eventually she was able to tone down her aggressive promotion of Tarhun, although she still could not abide an ill word spoken about her god and would often respond quite violently to such insults.  When she was twenty-three, Zaela came upon the settlement where she met Akala. Akala was kind and charming to Zaela and even offered her a place to stay. It was the kindest anyone had been to Zaela since her banishment, so she didn't want to spoil it by bringing up her religious beliefs.  Akala introduced Zaela to a wonderful circle of friends. Zaela was the happiest she could remember being, in spite of how odd many of the settlements locals were becoming – like they were going insane. She was more than happy to return Zaela's kindness by running errands, mostly bringing special pellets to the well that helped purify the water.  Then, one night, she awoke to find Akala sneaking out of the house. Zaela silently followed her to a secret meeting. Her stomach dropped at what she found. Akala and all of Zaela's new friends were there, their faces painted black, performing some ritual. She overheard enough clips of conversation to understand that the well was being drugged to drive the locals insane.  Filled with a holy rage, Zaela returned to Akala's house and pretended to be asleep while she came up with a plan. For the next two days, she took the pellets to the well but didn't drop them in. Then, on the third day, she approached the settlement's leaders with the pellets and told them what was going on – and who was involved.  The whole settlement was gathered and Zaela led the hunt for the cult members, eradicating them and putting an end to their plot – although, somehow, Akala managed to get away.  Unable to stay in the settlement with the painful memories, Zaela returned to her wandering. For the next two years she went back to her old routine, learning what she could of Tarhun and moving on. She grew tired of everyone thinking she was a child, so she filed her teeth to points and grinned at anyone who talked down to her – putting a quick end to the conversation. Later on she had a white lightning bolt tattooed on an angle across her face, further dissuading unpleasant conversations – though many mistook it as a scar.  At the age of twenty-five, she arrived in the city of Droum. There, at the Temple of the Whirlwind, Zaela met Stormcaller Leido and quickly took a liking to him. Here, at last, was someone who shared her understanding of Tarhun.  Zaela Thunderstruck decided that Droum might be a decent place to stay for a while."}]}

Luna is a tiefling barbarian."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A few months after she was born, Luna's parents were killed in a raid by a tribe of superstitious Gael barbarians. One of the raiders was a woman who had recently lost her child to illness. She pulled the horned and tailed baby from the wreckage of the house and brought her home to raise as her own, thinking to raise her to reject the evil magic that had led to her parents' destruction.  The infant tiefling caused the barbarian woman's husband to leave her, but the mother couldn't force herself to abandon the child. The rest of the tribe was just as unaccepting, however out of sympathy for the poor mother they were willing to tolerate the presence of the tiefling.  Luna grew up alone in a crowd, distrusted by her community. Her mother tied a headband over Luna's horns – preventing them from growing as large as those of the rest of her race – and dressed her as best she could to hide her tail in a desperate attempt to get her adopted daughter to fit in. It didn't work, especially because Luna enjoyed her tail too much to keep it hidden for long.  As Luna grew older, her mother's mind became less stable. She would go on raiding parties, leaving her daughter behind. No one else would care for Luna. The tiefling child took to stealing and eating boots to survive during these times, earning her the name “Bootsnatcher”. Her mother was appalled when she found out, but Luna insisted she quite liked the taste of boots.  As her mother's mental health deteriorated, Luna became neglected. She took to running away into the wilds, where she found her first friends in animals. Living off the land, as she had been taught, Luna would sometimes spend days or even weeks in the wilderness before her mother noticed she was missing and tracked her down, bringing her back home.  Always she would run away again when the cruel jokes of the other children became too much for her. Her animal friends trusted and didn't judge her. A pack of wolves became her particular favorites and she loved to emulate their behavior.  On one occasion, when she was sixteen fifteen and her taste buds were craving a boot, Luna realized that she had been with her wolf pack for over a month. Her mother had never left her that long before; she always came searching for her daughter. For the first time ever, Luna returned to her tribe of her own accord.  Upon arriving, she was told her mother had run off, screaming, during a raid and never come back. They said she had gone crazy. They said it was all Luna's fault. The tiefling was no longer welcome in the tribe.  Gathering her few belongings, Luna left. For a time she lived with her wolf pack, but she felt a hole in her chest that the animals couldn't fill. She missed her mother and the the love she gave – however sporadic it had been. Once again, Luna gathered her belongings.  This time, she headed north, out of Gaelengard, towards the so-called “civilized” lands where rumor had it “people like her” were more accepted."}]}

This character is an elf of the wizard class."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As it has so often before, the door to the tavern swings open, another weary traveler straggling in late from a long day of travel.  Normally, this garners nothing but grumbling from for letting the heat out and the snow in.  This time is different, though, for the breeze that precedes the latest arrival into the dimly lit common room smells of autumn, not of dead winter.  From beneath the hood of a cloak streaked scarlet and orange, two eyes, full of pain, reflect the light of the tavern’s fire – or perhaps the fire burns from inside.  A hand, too warm for flesh, clutches tightly a red staff, in the shape of a dragon rampant, breathing a quite whisper of flame, wavering in the draft. The stranger sets his pack, clanking and sloshing, down with the others at the door.  A quiet, raspy voice whispers, “A seat by the fire, a glass of sherry, and a room for the night, barkeep.”  For all that he speaks quietly, the voice seems to cut the air of the room like a knife.  As he steps into the room, the snow falls away from his boots as though repelled, and he leaves no footprints.    Caliban's obsession with fire began at the same time he became an orphan.  As an elfling, Christian RedLeaf discovered his father's tinderbox.  Like many children, he played with it, thinking it a toy.  His curiosity and innocence were to have disastrous consequences, as a spark from the tinderbox landed in his mother's forgotten glass of sherry.  It ignited, taking the lace curtains it was placed under with it.  Soon, the whole house was ablaze.  The family panicked, and his father, a roofer who dealt with tar for a living, was set ablaze by a brush with the curtains.  Still on fire, he lifted young Christian by the throat and threw him out the window, giving him the burn scar that adorns his throat and voice to this day.  The fire was put out by the Brotherhood of the Volcano, a local sect of fire warlocks, but not before consuming Christian's family and all of their belongings.  The kindly Brothers adopted the dazed and battered elfling, raising him to be one of them.  He turned out to be one of the most talented of their apprentices.  His natural intelligence served him well, but even more important was the fact that his earlier trauma had apparently attuned him to the element of fire in a deeper and more powerful way than anyone could have imagined.  However, along with this power came a deep sense of guilt for his family's deaths.  His aura, formerly bright and clear, slowly came to resemble the smoky flames of a funeral pyre. Eventually, he left the Brotherhood, dissatisfied with their inability, and his own, to cleanse him of his guilt.  RedLeaf wandered the world for a while, seeking to find some way to absolve his grief.  One autumn evening, drunk on cheap moonshine, and with a desire to make his exterior person resemble his soul, he commissioned a tattoo that would disfigure his face and ride his back the way his guilt rode his heart.  The result is both beautiful and hideous to behold, a Red Dragon poised to devour his right eye. The neck of the Dragon wraps around the scar on his throat to his back, where the main body of the Dragon is drawn.  The claws of the Dragon actually appear to be digging into the flesh and bone of his back as they perch on his lowest rib. The wings are stretched across his shoulders onto his upper arms, and finally, the tail of the dragon wraps underneath his left arm, ending at a point over his breastbone.  The tuft of the tail is a flame, poised over his heart.  Upon the completion of the tattoo, Christian took a new name for himself, choosing to be called simply, “Caliban”, the name of a mad demon elf, drawn from forgotten literature.  His search has led him now to Tolerance, home to many things... Including the ancient sect of the Fire Dancers.  With the last remnants of hope in his tortured heart, he has joined their dance, with the desire for absolution or oblivion, whichever comes first. "}]}

His beauty, though, is offset – or enhanced – by his frailty, a combination of his elven heritage and studious habits.  Jericho gives the impression of a powerful spirit, straining against the bounds of its too-mortal flesh.  Much like saints in classical paintings, he glows with the favor of ORB, a halo of sunlight emanating from within his powerful soul to literally light his path through the darkness of the material world.  Physical Description:  •Height: 5’ - 9” •Weight: 130 lbs. •Skin: Alabaster white •Hair: Auburn, worn shoulder length •Eyes: Green  Notable Features:  Aside from the halo, Jericho’s voice is one of his most notable features.  A highly trained tenor, his voice ranges from gravelly serious to foolishly light-hearted, and is never less than perfectly controlled.  He sings everything from High Masses to bawdy tavern tunes with equal skill, often incorporating original compositions into his performances.  Attire: •General Notes: Jericho’s attire varies depending on the situation, but he is never to be seen without his holy symbol, a beautifully made silver and gold sunburst. He typically wears the deep blues and gold of his order, even if not formally dressed. •Day-to-day wear: Jericho dresses in that intentionally sloppy style that has captivated women for millennia, favoring linen shirts, usually white, with a deep blue over-tunic. He typically wears his long hair tied back in a ponytail, and carries one or two books or stacks of sheet music. •Formal wear: When circumstances require formal wear, Jericho breaks out the ceremonial robes of his order – deep blue and flowing, with gold accents and a prominently displayed holy symbol. During these occasions, his aura and his sunburst glow with particular prominence. •Adventuring: When in dangerous situations, Jericho usually wears a mithril chain shirt and wool leggings, with high leather boots. A barely used mace hangs off his belt, and his holy symbol is in hand at all times. He also wears a flat necklace of very ancient design fitted tightly around his neck, and black leather bracers tooled in a Celtic knot style pattern.  •Carousing: Jericho’s tavern wear is much like his daily wear, with a few exceptions. Most noticeable is the mandolin, which, though well worn, is still a beautiful instrument with a tone equal to his voice.  He frequently wears an armband signifying him as a member of the Guild of Mask and Scroll, and his hair is usually worn down. So as not to draw the wrong kind of attention in these situations, he typically wills his aura into darkness. "}]}

He never met his father, a brief visitor to the Enclave who wooed his mother. He only ever heard whispers and murmurs that the man was a con artist. Denegar never asked his mother about the man; he never cared. What bothered him was the condescension from other acolytes. He was constantly told he would never amount to anything. Though his mother was a powerful mage, little was expected of him. And after a certain point, he stopped caring.  While he practiced magic and studied, he did so lazily or not at all. Most often, he could be found trying to trick younger acolytes. He used a mixture of magic and plain charm to convince the younger children of the value of random trinkets he had obtained. When he was discovered the first time, he used that same charm to slip away with a warning. When he was caught a second time, the Teacher who caught him was less forgiving. She wanted him punished severely for his misconduct. In a stroke of luck, he manifested a powerful illusion which held her attention long enough for him to slip away. This time, he knew he had to leave the Enclave. He grabbed his pack and instrument from his quarters and left a note for his mother.   Denegar made it to the docks and convinced a merchant ship to let him board as a performer. Much like his other studies, he had neglected practicing his instrument, so he found himself playing catch up at a pace that was nothing less than terrifying. He managed to stumble his way through enough performances to make it to Jisha. The ship only briefly stopped there to resupply. It was also enough time for Denegar to acquire a ring from one of the Tabaxi. It was then that he conceived his greatest con; Duke Martin Guerre.  As the vessel sailed towards Obrar, he began fabricating the tale of a Duke who had been denied his heritage. He knew that faking the position of a landed noble would be impossible, but he might be able to pull this off. As soon as they arrived on the shores of Obrar, he set to work. In smaller towns outside of Quereth, he is known as Martin Guerre. He only arrived in Quereth recently and is looking for ways to increase his wealth and status so that he can increase the image of Martin Guerre, the disgraced duke."}]}

At birth, his mother flipped a coin to decide whether to eat him or not. Luckily for Gorton it landed on tails.  At an early age, Gorton became lost and found himself in a human village. He met a barren old spinster who, longing for her own children, adopted (read: stole) him and took it upon herself to give him an education. Also she was a bit crazy from the syphilis. Gorton learnt to read after being given 7 scrolls that told the fictional tale of a boy wizard. This is what started his love affair with magic.  As he reached his teenage years, he decided to pursue a career in Wizardry rather than follow in the footsteps of his long forgotten mother. Barbarianism didn't interest him.  He soon adopted a toad as his familiar. Whilst trying to perform a levitation spell on the creature, he accidentally turned it inside-out. After confirming that there was still a pulse, Gorton named the toad Giblets, as that is what he now resembles. Giblets occasionally pulsates, but mostly he attracts circling crows. Most recently he has been travelling the lands, using his rudimentary literacy skills to learn magic. He's still pretty terrible at it and is prone to rage fits when his spells don't work.  Because he can't grow his own facial hair due to poor genetics from his father's side, Gorton wears a fake beard to make himself look wiser and more magicy. His greatest fear is someone discovering that it's actually a second-hand merkin weaved from boar hair. He also draws a scar over his left eye, similar to the one the boy wizard from his scrolls had. This is prone to disappearing in the rain.  His wizard robe is blue with gold trim. It's also several sizes too small, and ripped in places.  One day he hopes to meet his father, if only just to apologise."}]}

He is a monk and belongs to the genasi race."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Early life Born in a mid-sized town on the border of the inland sea, Sorra was marked as an outsider from birth. A mixture of her appearance, and a natural tendency for her to ‘snap’ and quickly become enraged, led to Sorra being rather isolated from other children. Sorra’s mother raised her alone, with no other siblings and no extended family still in contact with them.  She never knew her father – or even exactly what shade of being he was. Sorra’s mother did not talk about him when at all possible. Sorra always resented her mother, largely seeing her as to blame for her ‘condition’. Shortly after she turned 16, Sorra’s latent magical potential began to manifest, and she soon left home. Tutelage Sorra was picked up by a passing wise man named Chòt, who spent his years travelling from town to town with various merchant caravans. Predominantly Chòt was a medicine-man to the townsfolk, treating sickness or providing herbs in exchange for the means of scraping out a meagre living. Often, he would gather the local children and in exchange for a few coppers, teach them a lesson from among the seemingly endless depths of his memory and experience. More rarely, adults of a village might come to him for spiritual guidance, wisdom or arbitration. It was perhaps in this area most of all that he served as Sorra’s mentor.  Chòt taught Sorra about her condition. About the types of being that represented who her father might be. He taught her that the elemental blood swirling within her was a challenge she was destined to overcome. Her magic, her rage – all traces of her heritage – could be overcome with rigorous application of mind and body. Sorra strove to control her wild natural state of emotions, suppressing them under layers of control. Through hard physical labour, she learnt the strength necessary to suppress what she thought of as her inner demons. In time, Chòt would come to teach her how to become closer to the pinnacle of perfection, in mind, body and spirit. Spitting in defiance of her imagined father, Sorra strove to conquer her chaotic self.  With the passing years, Chòt grew older, and sickly. Several times, their travels were aborted while the old man was laid up in bed, Sorra having to balance gathering herbs and preparing remedies at his instruction, with working to earn food and board for the two while he rested at an inn. True to his dedication to a physical ideal, though, whenever his health looked on the mend Chòt would pack up and press on, heading back to the beaten trail. House Blackvyne It was during this time, that Chòt was called upon by Lord Blackvyne, while traversing the realms of his Duchy. The Lord’s own coterie of astrologers, clairvoyants and other knowledgeable courtiers was inaccurate, or could not be trusted, or too personally involved – Sorra never really found out why the Lord came to her mentor. Neither did she know what matter of spiritual or moral council he sought; later, she came to suspect that it had to do with Lord Blackvyne’s place in the broiling politics that was shortly to erupt into war. Whatever it was, Blackvyne was most gracious to Chòt afterwards, but instead of accepting payment the old man simply asked the duke to take Sorra on as an advisor. The road was becoming ever more dangerous, and Chòt’s health ever-weaker; Sorra, now twenty-three was in the prime of her life, Chòt had told her, and was ready to strike out on her own.  Sorra never saw the old man again. A few weeks later, a messenger arrived from the next village along on the old man’s route, bearing news of plague. Whether he was caught in the outbreak she did not know, but it seemed likely and, given his health, she doubted Chòt could have survived. The duke himself had grown large on fat meat and good wine, and needed a change in lifestyle if he were to keep up his lifestyle of hunting. He took Sorra on as a wellbeing instructor, the young woman’s excellent knowledge of athletic discipline bringing a small ray of rejuvenation into the aging lord’s life.  Even in all of her travels, Sorra had grown used to staring looks, mistrust, abuse and occasionally even physical assaults from the locals of whatever villages they passed on their travels. Before Lord Blackvyne, no-one had ever simply accepted her, seen her for the freak of nature that she was, and then taken her in anyway. Well, no one except Chòt. Blackvyne was able to look under her disfigurement and see what, in Sorra’s own mind, was the disciplined young woman whose very body spoke of her underlying mastery of physical discipline. For that, she was forever grateful to the duke, and served him as dutifully as she had her old mentor."}]}

His parents were important envoys involved in diplomatic relations between the elves and humans as well as being notable for attempting to pursue a long term peaceful relationship with the local orc bands. Due to their bust schedules Dorion spent most of his time alone, wandering the forests and other natural areas of the world. Dorion became fascinated by nature and particularly a family of brown bears living in the area, for years Dorion studied this family of bears, forsaking his chores and working life to disappear into the woods and become part of the great ecosystem. Whilst living largely in the wilderness Dorion learned to channel the power of nature, despite generally being considered a weak child Dorion learned to move with grace and lethality through the forests. However when he was but 30 years old bold orc hunting parties started frequenting the forest. After they had killed several members of his beloved bear family, a distraught Dorion marshalled the animals of the wood and lead a swift, brutal assault on the orc camp. Dorion himself slew the orc chieftain in hand to hand combat, ducking around the slow clumsy blows of his greataxe and cutting him down. Afterwards Dorion searched the camp and found a baby orc crying desperately for his parents. Dorion could not bring himself to slay the innocent child and left the baby orc outside one of the major orc encampments. Fearing how his parents would react to his blatant acts of aggression Dorion fled from the island. For many years afterwards he travelled the wild learning all he could about the natural world. Gradually he understood how rash his actions had been and that alternatives to bloodshed should always be pursued if at all possible. Dorion generally spends most of his time in the wilds, living alongside the animals of the wilds. He will occasionally rest in a village paying his way with rare flowers and trophies from animals. Whilst he has mellowed over time Dorion is still a staunch defender of the natural world and can’t abide large cities and towns which don’t somehow incorporate nature into their construction. "}]}

He is a human ranger."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The old world died on the night of December 31, 1999. As the sun dipped across the horizon around the world, the darkness brought with it a terrible Event - a sudden super-imposition of an unnatural forest across the landscape of the globe. Trees shattered roads and broke buildings, killing millions in architectural collapses and road accidents across the world as thick forest growth was suddenly everywhere, passing right through man’s technological civilization. The news media, and the Freedom League, had time to track the horrific event as it happened, beginning in eastern China and stretching across the planet with the terrible fall of darkness, time to observe that the new growth matched whatever forests were native to the landscape they were devouring - but not time to stop it.   In the frigid days after the catastrophe, those few places that still had power were reassured by the government and by the Freedom League that help was coming. But no help came. It was the heroes who vanished first; the superheroes and brave humans who went into the forest looking for answers. And then the others began to vanish too - humans all over the planet left behind their families, their loved ones, and simply walked into the newborn Forest Primeval.   The mystery of their disappearances was solved when they returned, feral and maddened by animal impulses and predatory desires, and began attacking the surviving human communities. The war between the Children of the Forest and the survivors of the old world lasted for several years and resulted in the deaths of most of the world’s surviving superhumans and many of the survivors - there was no treaty, no negotiation, no mercy - the Ferals simply stopped coming.   Gradually the survivors learned how to cope with the new world - how to forage in the cities for food and gear without being caught by the Maddening Wild (avoiding the darkness was the key), how to resist the Maddening Wild’s call (sticking together in groups was the ticket), and about the small number of people, all of them without other superpowers, who had the ability to forage in the woods _without_ being maddened by the Wild.   2015 is the fifteenth year since the world ended. Freedom City lies, broken, by an impossibly old oak and pine forest in which trees with hundreds of years worth of rings lie at the heart of the civilization they impaled. The largest population of survivors lies at the edge of the city, a few thousand hearty souls dwelling in the community around the Raymond Nuclear Power Plant at the edge of North Bay. They can go into the city to scavenge and explore, but only during daylight hours. The Maddening Wild still calls - though perhaps less forcefully than it did in the grim days at the start of the new century. The woods themselves are haunted by the past - the murdered city they devoured, and what lies within.  The Ferals themselves are dangerous enough, savage, animalistic humanoids, many of them with superpowers, but they are not the worst of it. The Forest Primeval came with animals too; bears and wolves and bobcats, all the creatures once endemic to coastal New Jersey. But they came back unnatural - too clever by half, and with an intelligence that has grown unnaturally in recent years. Bears have been seen in the Deep Woods wearing human clothing, and wolves howling to each other in some grim parliament. They have shown a terrible intelligence when fighting humans - hitting men carrying flashlights to blind them in the dark, making man-like noises to lure unwary travelers, and otherwise making it clear that the forest is theirs. Many kill not to feed - but to terrify the human survivors. The Forest is full of monsters - and the Forest is everywhere.     Riley Quinn was only about two months old at the Millennium. His parents, Casey and Peyton Smith-Quinn, lived in North Bay when he was born - their home was a mansion, small by the standards of the neighborhood, but spacious enough after the relative poverty of their youths in Mississippi. Maybe because they came from poverty themselves, with a history of dealing with emergency situations, they took action promptly on that terrible night of the 31st as the news of threatening global destruction came. When the Forest Primeval hit Freedom City, they had taken shelter at the nearby Raymond Nuclear Plant where his mother worked as a plant nuclear engineer, trusting in its solid construction to save them. And it did, to an extent - the Forest devoured the plant, too, but fate, radioactivity, and maybe just good engineering kept Raymond together. An oak tree's sudden growth shattered one reactor and a scrub pine forest sent one cooling tower cascading to the Earth in a deadly shower of debris, but quick hands prevented a meltdown and even kept electricity pumping from the plant's generators. It was a natural place to send refugees in the early days before the true horror of the situation had settled in.    Riley doesn't remember much about those days, but he's heard the stories a thousand times. The way the refugees at the power plant first scavenged for food, then began growing crops in their own right in the hastily-converted greenhouses. The way desperate engineers babied a wounded power plant, keeping two of five nuclear reactors alive and producing life-giving electricity even a decade and a half after the end of the world. The way they built a school, and a chapel, and a clinic, and a hospital out of the old plant, building an outpost to human dreams in the middle of an inhuman wilderness. The days when the Ferals hit the fences almost daily. The crack of gunfire, then of melee weapons, again and again. The heroic sacrifice of Lady Liberty, who finally succumbed to infection days after her last battle with the group of Feral metahuman teenagers who had so often led attacks against the reactors, willing to poison the whole city to stop the power plant.  The horrific screams from Lonely Point as what had been the populations of Bayview and Port Regal, backed by a rampaging Feral Captain Thunder broke through the defenses. His father, whose cancer could have been easily caught five years earlier, and his grave in the old plant garden.  Riley is almost certain he can remember his father's voice.   For various reasons, Riley grew up dissatisfied with his lot in life. He had ample reason for this, raised in a community at the edges of a world murdered by the Forest Primeval. He knew how lucky they were, especially compared to other survivor communities that lacked things like power, machine shops, and other tools providing some echo of what had once been modern life, but he also knew from his exploration of the (long-since-picked-over) homes near the Raymond site just how much they'd lost. So he dreamed, in between schoolhouse lessons and chapel prayers, between working in the greenhouse and going fishing, of the world that had been lost - and the wonders that had once been his birthright. But most of all, when he climbed the long-deserted Cooling Tower #4 and looked out at tree-skewered Freedom, he dreamed of the lost city of Freedom, and wondered what secrets lay within.    Now these were no small dreams in the Raymond community, not when once a year or so someone would zone out and be sucked into the Maddening Wild, wandering into the Forest Primeval to either be eaten by animals or join the Ferals. So he kept them to himself as he got older, instead learning his mother's engineering skills with the idea of one day taking her place managing the reactors. But boys will be boys - by day he read technical manuals and worked in the machine shop, and by night he studied old city maps and the notes of those few explorers who had survived the journey into Freedom Primeval. On his fifteenth birthday, he presented himself to the Security Force as a volunteer for the Woodsmen, a dangerous, but highly valued part of life in their little community given the number of things the community's technology needed to survive - and how valuable the remaining scraps of super-tech scattered through the city still were. His mother wasn't happy - but after he demonstrated his skills at climbing and hunting, at marksmanship and hiding, even she couldn't say no.    Freedom Primeval was everything he'd dreamed - beautiful and terrifying, wonderful and dangerous, marvelous and lethal. He rested in the shade of the oak trees that had split Freedom Hall in half; he battled the wolf colony that had taken over lost Lincoln. He fought a desperate battle against the Feral pack in Bayview; he prayed beneath the pine tree cathedral in St. Sebastian's Church. From his fellow Woodsmen, he learned how to sneak and survive in the city, how to hunt and fish to keep himself alive (skills he'd already begun to learn in Raymond), and how to navigate the ruined metropolis. He also learned how to kill - building his own crossbow, he was able to fend off attacks from bears, wolves, and other of the too-clever, too-wise beasts roaming Freedom City. And the unclever beasts too - the savage, cannibalistic Ferals who might once have been people. It was grim work; but it was war. No - it was survival.    At the beginning of summer, 2015, Riley joined his fellow Woodsmen on an especially dangerous mission - a scrounging run into the heart of the Goodman Building, loaded with vital super-technology that, suitably adapted as spare parts, could potentially keep the Raymond reactors running for another decade and a half. But the risk was great. The Atom children had survived the Forest Primeval, though tree damage had eventually destroyed their grandfather's systems - but become a particularly bloodthirsty pack of Ferals. But the risk was greater than the Woodsmen knew - the Atom pack had, by whatever inhuman, unholy means, _bred_ - and a pack of Feral, superpowered younglings waited inside the tree-ruined building to greet them. Separated from the rest and trying to tune out the screams of horror he heard from his fellows, Riley ran. Fleeing down a darkened, overgrown emergency stair, he found his way blocked and so ducked inside what turned out to be a long-abandoned, nearly pristine research laboratory.    Fascinated by the discovery, Riley locked the doors behind him and wandered through what had once been Alexander Atom's sanctum sanctorum. He was particularly fascinated by one particular piece of technology; a big, circular, open disc mounted in the middle of the room - one that he realized with some shock still was powered up! Succumbing to temptation, he pressed a few buttons, bringing the big machine to life with a whine of long-dead circuits and the sudden sound of alarms! At the sound of fists pounding on the door he'd locked behind him and against the inhuman shrieks outside, Riley hefted his crossbow and dived through the hole to take up a firing position on the other side.    Except he found himself somewhere else entirely.    The Goodman Building had seen its share of dimensional refugees before and while Riley (or 'Woodsman' as he called himself initially, with vague memories of watching some old war movies on the projector in his school) was different than others, there was nothing particularly alien about him compared to some of the visitors they'd seen. He was kept in isolation for nearly two weeks, both to make sure he was no longer violent (he had made free use of his crossbow to try and escape the populated, brightly-lit, tree-free laboratory he'd stumbled into) and to make sure that whatever mysterious disaster had beset his homeworld wouldn't be coming with him. But nobody had any answers - consultants like Phantom and Harrier were unfamiliar with either the timeline he described or the kind of apocalypse that had destroyed his world's native civilization, and something seemed to make it impossible to return him to his homeworld. All attempts to trace the dimensional line that he carried with him led to tangled snarls along the generally smooth course of the Cosmic Coil.    Being unable to go home was hard. He knew his mother, his fellow Woodsmen, and his people would think he was dead - devoured by the Atom pack. And how strange it was to see them, alive and well, in a healthy, thriving city full of living human beings! As much as he missed home, he loved this place. He avidly read every book he could get his hands on and (once he learned how to use modern computers) and soon found himself taking online high school classes to keep up. He was behind in a lot of areas, but not too far behind - and determined to make up for lost ground as soon as possible. If he couldn't go home yet, and if even this world full of living cities and heroes had no answers for him, he could at least make himself better here. Once he was out of isolation, he could even go to the building's gym, where he kept himself in shape by exercise and drill, determined not to lose a step when he made it back home.    Riley was so focused on learning about Earth-Prime that he barely noticed when it was time to move out. He was shocked by the thought; where could he possibly go? But then his counselor told him remarkable news - news that in retrospect he could immediately have expected. On this world, Riley Smith and his mother Peyton lived in their North Bay mansion just as they always had after his father had divorced his mother six years earlier. (And what a strange thought that was!) And that other Peyton, upon learning that a dimension-lost version of her son was in Freedom City, had thrown open her doors to that other Riley.    They talked by email, then by phone, Riley a little surprised by his counterpart's voice - had he been born different in this universe? Riley and Riley met in one of the Goodman Building's rec rooms - Riley was reading a book while his counterpart, noticeably taller and heavier, entered the room, his sharp suit a contrast to Riley's flannel shirt, windbreaker, and jeans - all of them clothes he'd taken with him from his own planet. Riley met the eyes of his counterpart, saw his mustache and goatee, heard his deep-voiced, tentative greeting, and despite himself blurted out a question that, months later, still embarrasses him.    \"Jesus! How did you grow a mustache?!\"   Riley had read about his condition in pre-Millennium books, of course - in the old days, men born with women's bodies had treated themselves with testosterone, the male hormone. But synthetic testosterone was out of reach of Raymond's medical facilities (an expanded version of the old plant's emergency clinic) and crystallizing it from other men was an idea that made him nervous. So he'd resigned himself to a lifetime of bulky clothing over tight bindings, and probably never getting so much as a girlfriend, much less getting married. But in the Prime reality, the chemicals were readily available - with a doctor's prescription, anyway. His double had come out to his parents at the age of 12 and had been transitioning (a whole new word!) ever since - and had been on hormones for years. This really was, he decided the first time he took a hormone shot, a wonderful dimension.    But of course it wasn't as easy as that. The two Rileys sharing a room was not the same as having a sibling; it was like having a shadow, and an alien one, at that. Riley-Prime was a smart kid on the school academic challenge team, a member of the Gay-Straight Alliance on campus and a future nuclear engineer. The other Riley was restless and angular, sleeping on the floor or a rope hammock, roaming the rooftops by night and converting the basement into a lab to rebuild his crossbow. One Riley had lost his beloved father to cancer and an early grave; the other Riley had lost his father to divorce when he was in his early teens. (It had been acrimonious - Casey hardly saw his family anymore) Competing for a mother's love, both of them young men going through changes, they clashed - and finally they fought. Healthy and strong though he was, Riley-Prime was no trained fighter; and the Riley from offworld hadn't learned to pull his punches.    The loss of his temper, the feeling of boiling, surging rage, and the look on Peyton's face all came together to make Riley feel for a frightening moment like he'd gone Feral - like he was the barbarian his counterpart had accused him of being. He grabbed his crossbow and jumped out his window, vanishing into the North Bay night over the alien sound of arriving sirens. Running away from the angry, frightened reflection of his mother, Riley roamed the city for four days, scrounging to survive and even stealing a dose of synthetic testosterone, before Bowman tracked him down and gave him two pieces of news.  One was that his mother, and even his counterpart, had forgiven him - his counterpart had even reluctantly admitted to provoking him into the fight, even though Riley was pretty sure that had been all him. The other piece of news came from Bowman himself. He'd tracked Riley through the city and been impressed by his stealth and ability to survive - and had helped clean up after Riley had used some well-placed speciality crossbow bolts to take down a gang who'd been harassing homeless kids by the airport. Bowman couldn't help Riley figure out where he fit in on Earth-Prime, but he could make a suggestion - there was this school Bowman himself had graduated from..."}]}

For this reason, though, he found favor in the eyes of the archbishop receiving perceived preferential treatment and his companionship.       This upset the rest of the order but things only got worse when the Archbishop fell mortally ill. On his deathbed, the Archbishop proclaimed that his successor would be Cal, which sparked an uproar from the rest of the older and perhaps wiser priests, particularly a longstanding priest named Gnoland.       Gnoland set out to find some sort of scandal or dark secret or anything to pin against Cal to show him unfit to be archbishop. Cal was aware of Gnoland’s plot but was confident that he was safe.       After months of fruitless searching and with Cal's inauguration nearing Gnoland sought one of Cal's closest friends, Lea Argelle, and promised him a high position in their order if he could divulge any damning evidence against Cal. Lea caved to his greed and shared that Cal had a lover, Wyn. While it was against the law of their order to take a wife, nothing legally stopped the priests from getting physical needs taken care of from time to time. Lea urged though that this was not a simple harlot but was like a wife to him. Gnoland knew that he would not be able to use this info directly to incriminate Cal but he planned to use her as leverage.       He and his guards set off to her location, as divulged by Lea, to take her into custody. This was not as easy a task as Gnoland had initially presumed, as Wyn was a seasoned adventurer before settling down after having met Cal. She killed two of the guards and wounded Gnoland before he ordered his remaining four men to kill her rather than capture her. She was the more skilled combatant but she was outnumbered and thus she was slain. Gnoland ordered his men to take care of the fallen guards and leave no evidence of their involvement making it look like it must have been outlaws that had murdered her.       When Cal heard that Lea had been consorting with Gnoland he rushed home only to find his love dead on the floor. He used all the healing magic he could but she was already gone. Knowing there was nothing he could do in his current state; Cal forsook his faith with Pelor and begged Wee Jas a goddess of death to bestow her power to him in an attempt to bring her back from the dead. Cal felt a new, darker power flow through his being. He cast aside his old holy symbol and etched the flaming skull of Wee Jas onto his ring that he wore to symbolize his love to Wyn. He cast his ritual to the extent of his ability but nothing happened.       Distraught, Cal thought his spell had failed but then Wyn started to move. As she stood up Cal was overjoyed! However, that soon turned to horror as he realized that this was not his love. Wyn’s body was moving but her spirit was not with her. The soulless husk of Wyn’s body groaned as it struggled to stay upright. Its dark eyes surveyed the dark room until it saw Cal; all of a sudden, it lurched violently towards him letting out an unearthly screech.       Cal resited the attack and managed to find a small hand axe left behind by one of the guards. Through tears, Cal slew the revenant and once again, his lover’s motionless body lay before him.       He knew that forsaking his devotion to Pelor would be heavily frowned upon let alone consorting with necromancy. Cal had to flee the city lest he too end up dead. Gnoland had won, Lea had betrayed him, and it seemed that all was lost.       He only had one goal as he set off; he had to grow in power so that he could one day bring back Wyn’s soul and bring Gnoland’s corrupted priesthood to justice. "}]}

Her father, Alastor Wise, is known throughout the Riordane Empire as the dear friend of the Last Emperor, having saved his life in circumstances that have been subject to the Empire's rumor mills (but does anyone know what really happened? Not really, no. Anyone who could tell you about the incident is likely dead.). Alastor, in truth, was a sculptor who believed deeply in the tenents of Yvaine, the goddess of love, and he was equally deeply in trouble when the Katalivorg family discovered their young daughter, Klara, was romantically involved with Alastor. He was just a yeoman artisan from the capital - and he was deemed \"unfit for the fate of the family\" by the Katalivorg patriarch, Adim.  The Katalivorg family is known throughout Old Riordane as... questionably aligned. By no means were they darlings of the Empire or of even their own subjects. They just seemed somehow removed from the petty politics of the Empire. The Katalivorg family is cloaked in mystery and darkness, but they do wield some unnatural power. Klara grew up knowing that someday, she would be brought into the fold, but also knowing deep in her heart that she was not meant for it and was instinctually averse to becoming part of the Katalivorg legacy. Instead, she was attracted to light and beauty and good things, which eventually brought her to Alastor.  Naturally, the Katalivorg's first move upon discovering this scandal was to find Alastor and have him killed by an assassin. Lucky for Alastor, Klara was an incredibly sneaky woman and she heard her family plotting her lover's demise without them even knowing. So, she packed a few things and took off into the night to find Alastor and run away with him. They came immediately to the Emperor's Palace in Abrogail to a warm welcome by the imperial family. Klara and Alastor spoke with the Emperor for many hours, and came out of the Palace in the middle of the night, now the earl and countess of what was now called \"the Wiselands,\" and swiftly transported thence under an assigned troop of tuneless bards, who were really some of the Imperial Guard.  Willa was the first child of Alastor and Klara Wise, born in the spring. She was raised humbly, given a grand education befitting the leader she was born to be, and grew up loving, to varying degrees, nearly everyone she ever met. Truly, she grew to be the best of both her parents, and even threw in some personal twists of being musical, poised in moments of negotiation, and unseemingly scrappy when negotiations broke down. Naturally, when The Tear randomly appeared in the middle of the Empire leaking goblins, she went headfirst into the aptly named Goblin War. The Wise family, though fearful for their daughter's life, knew that when a calling was placed on someone, it was placed for a damn good reason. So they let her go. And how Willa thrived. She gained trusted comrades, made decisions where all the options were double-edged, grew in skill both musically and in weaponry, grew in faith as she learned to forgive what was recognized as a problem by all involved parties, and was a fighter until the end.  The night the Goblin War ended with the sacking of Abrogail and the murder of the entire Imperial family sent a shock to Willa's core. She knew the people whose bodies were now on pikes outside the ruins of Abrogail, even... even loved them. She knew that she had to go back to the Wiselands then, see the castle, hold her father, kiss her mother's cheek, give her brother Omar a noogie for old time's sake. It was then that what remained of Willa's battalion separated, many returning to their homes, but a fair number remaining with Willa, for they had no homes to return to. So, Willa and her band of lost soldiers returned to the Wiselands.  Upon reaching the Wiselands, Willa had noticed that everything was silent, even in the small town near the castle. When her searching, perceptive eyes saw the drawbridge of the castle down and a little wrecked, she ran. When her comrades caught up to her, they saw something they were all too used to seeing - hundreds of bodies, all on pikes, and one person standing in the middle of the carnage, their very own Willa Wise. Unlike the other times, though, Willa was not weeping - she was still, unresponsive, emotionless, staring at the body of a man. It took a very long time for her to respond to their question of \"Who is this?\" All she managed was a small, \"Dad,\" before an unnatural cry, seemingly ripped from her very soul, came out of her mouth and she collapsed at the dangling feet of her father and sobbed for so long. Her fellows carried her kicking and screaming from the castle when they saw soldiers dressed in black armor coming from beyond, carrying the banner of none other than the Katalivorg family.  As they reached the forests beyond the farmlands around the castle, Willa had quieted, looking back at the castle with puffy, red eyes. Her fellows set her down, and immediately, she walked deeper into the forest. Her companions did not follow her. They knew she had things to think on.  And think she did.  As the night set in and she wandered the forest she had played in as a child, she came to a small clearing where the stars were so clear in the sky. She looked up, and after many silent minutes into her stargazing, she asked, \"What will I do, Yvaine? I am so... lost.\" All of a sudden, a great bevy of stars began shooting across the night sky, her very body began glowing as brightly as a star, itself, and then, just before the light became too much for her mind to handle, a voice, feminine, soft, gentle, yet firm resounded around her, \"You will fight, as you were born to do, Willa Wise.\" Then, she passed out. She awoke, as the sun just began to peak over the horizon, to someone's face nearly filling her eyesight. As she focused, she gasped as her heart began to fly.  It was Omar.  She began to laugh and cry with her dear brother whom she had feared lost forever. She held him, kissed his cheek - hell, she even gave him a noogie for old time's sake. Omar told her of the attack on the castle, how he was interrupted from his studies by their mother, how on their way to the kitchen, a bunch of goblins intercepted them and took Klara howling to her son to \"RUN!\", how the kitchen staff brandished their butcher's knives and rollers, meat hammers and pokers and defended him from the intruding horde of goblins as he escaped through a secret passage behind an oven. Omar had run into the forest, and watched the goblins, maniacally laughing as they hoisted black banners with the Katalivorg standard to the skies, leave nearly as quickly as they had come. The town was left unpillaged, but they all knew what had happened. The citizens were merely waiting for their new rulers to come, and they were quaking in their boots. They knew who the Katalivorgs were.  At that moment, Willa knew what she'd be doing now. She had received her blessing from Yvaine. She walked with Omar in her wake as she lit herself up again and she burned like the morning sun. She returned to her compatriots and said to them, \"Friends, the war is not over for me yet.\" She outlined a plan of expedient guerrilla tactics and robbing the Katalivorg nobles to give to the needy vassals and yeomen of the surrounding lands. \"But, Willa, what of Yvaine? Is this not against her tenants?\" one of her comrades asked. Willa gave a mirthless grunt of laughter. \"No. Yvaine has given me the calling to fight for this. We're going to give these motherfuckers a price for the invasion of the Wiselands.\"  And so they have been for the past few months, becoming folk heroes, not just in the Wiselands, but beyond. Willa herself has allowed herself her humanity again, to see beauty and happiness and laughter, despite the troubled times. Her Omar, darling baby brother he will always be, was never cut out for violence, and so has instead invested himself to traveling as much of the world as he possibly can and putting what he sees down on a map. He plans on returning soon, having written to Willa that he was traveling to explore the city of Ulkenbac in the Ashlands. Feeding her unease about her brother's safety, that letter was written two months ago. There has been no letter since. So, she has set out from the Wiselands to find her brother - hopefully alive."}]}

While visiting his wife Holly in Neverwinter, he fought off a terrorist attack (by the Zhentarim).

Jon didn’t cope well with this; he kept it in. His previous disagreements with Holly began to compound and overflow when he shut her out of his troubles. After one particularly bad shift, he came home to find a letter from Neverwinter: she has new opportunity and she’s cutting him loose to give it her all with a clean slate. She didn’t tell him what or where. (We’re in the beginning of Die Hard 3 here.) His spiral went deeper. He was soon suspended, demoted, suspended again, and ultimately transferred to police the northern roads reaching to Thornhold and Amphail. (The City Watch usually doesn’t operate outside of the city walls, but apparently one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep… motivated the Commander of the Watch to make an exception.)  This unique and solitary jurisdiction turned out to suit John well. He slowly found some peace with himself in this more isolated job --- one he’s excelling at again --- at the thinner edges of civilization. There are still good people living here, putting in hard work, taking care of each other, and fighting off the wilderness with barely token help from the city’s nobles back behind their walls.  Over time John found the core Waterdhavian laws that most tenaciously uphold have been now revealed to be reflections of those of Nature and the balanced participation of people in.

He’s long since retired from the Waterdeep city watch, but his Emerald Enclave tasks do occasionally drag him reluctantly back into the human strongholds of the North: Waterdeep, Neverwinter, and so on. Returning to those places haunted by his old life never goes well, and he avoids it as much as possible.  Now that he’s centered himself, John has relaxed his focus on Enclave matters just enough to start wondering about a new mission: finding Holly and making things right again, showing her his new life."}]}

He is a human rogue."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fritz Hanswurst was born in the wagon of a travellin’ show; his Mama used to dance for the money  they’d throw. Fritz learned, from an early age, how to accompany her dances on various  instruments—lute, flute, concertina, bones—and how to collect the thrown money before the  drunker folks in the front of the crowd tried to reclaim it and turn it into more ale. He and his  younger sister, Helena, would seamlessly trade off musical duties to take turns fetching the coins that  showered the stage (or, in harder times, sprinkled it) while ducking the whirling limbs of Mama and  their two older sisters, Berthe and Marja.   In between dances came the songs, the stories, the jokes, the acrobatics. Fritz and Helena  sang treble against Berthe and Mama’s deeper contraltos; Marja, not much of a singer, was the  money collector then, but when it came time to get the crowd laughing, she took command of the  performance. All of the children were acrobats—Mama had trained them, almost from birth it  seemed, to juggle, flip, balance, leap, and twist in ways that made women gasp and men struggle to  pretend they hadn’t gasped just as loudly. During the acrobatic segments, their rickety wagon barely  managed to support the more elaborate routines, many of which threatened to hurl the Hanswurst  children out into the audience, all of whom waited breathlessly for just such an instance. The only  one who didn’t take part in any of this was Papa.  Fritz’s Papa wasn’t a singer or a dancer, a juggler or a comedian; all of those gifts came from  Mama. Papa would do whatever he could—preach a little gospel, sell a couple bottles of “Dr.  Good.” Dr. Good wasn’t really that different from the ale the drunks wanted, but at least the coins  that paid for the Dr. ended up in the family’s tattered purses, not stuck to the bar of some seedy  village saloon. The gospel Papa preached changed from town to town, depending on the local God.  That was Papa’s gift; he could make a crowd feel a religious ecstasy the priests of the temples never  could. During his speeches, nobody moved to collect coins or to throw them, but after he was done  the shower usually began in earnest, enough to require all the children at once.  Fritz hated all of it: the singing, dancing, juggling, preaching—especially the preaching—and  the travelling. The wagon wasn’t big enough for them all to sleep inside, so he usually ended up on  the ground under it, huddled up against Helena with only one ratty blanket between them. Papa’s  snoring, as thunderous as his prayers, shook the wagon nightly, pelting them with the grit that had  settled into the boards over the long days of roaming between villages and towns, or during the even  longer days of show after show in the cities. It hadn’t been so bad when Fritz was younger, sleeping  inside the wagon with Mama, but when Helena was born he’d been kicked underneath, and he had  only stopped resenting her when she chose to join him in his exile, warming him more than the  blanket ever had. He still resented Mama and Papa.  Life changed when Fritz was twelve, and not just in the way that life changes for everyone at  about that age. For Fritz, those intimate, personal changes spurred him to bigger ones, ones that  disrupted the family routine for everyone. In Riversend one evening, after a particularly successful  run of performances, the family dispersed to purchase the supplies they needed for their next  sojourn, through Tal Morai to Easar and stopping everywhere along the way and some places that  weren’t. Fritz, with Helena in tow, was to purchase tar—the wagon had long needed patching, and  there was nowhere in the kingdom where tar was cheaper.  The man (or boy really, but 16 seems like a man to a twelve-year-old) who was selling tar at  the first booth the children encountered was stunning. Perfectly formed, in Fritz’s eyes, the man  was slender, pale-skinned, and had close-cropped hair that might have bespoken a need to keep his  head tar-free, but to Fritz appeared just the height of fashion. Fritz gaped and stammered and  bought twice the tar the family needed, at nearly three times the price it was worth. He was smitten.  When Mama saw the amount of tar he and overburdened little Helena brought back to the  wagon camped outside of town, her eyes hardened. When she heard what they had paid for it, they  nearly popped out of her head. Her furious berating far outdid anything Papa was capable of at his loudest, whether preaching or snoring; she nearly upended one of the buckets over Fritz’s head, but  Marja restrained her, and she merely slopped it onto the already black and stinking soil. After some  adroit questioning from Berthe, Helena revealed the reason for Fritz’s fiscal irresponsibility, and the  younger women nodded knowingly; they’d seen the young tar merchant in question, and they could  tell precisely why poor Fritz, usually so good with money for his age, had been no match for his  salesmanship. Mama and Papa were far from pleased, but there was nothing they could do—the tar  merchants didn’t take their wares back. A few more choice words from Mama, with supportive  growls from her husband, and the matter was closed.  But for Fritz, it was far from over. The young tar merchant, all unknowingly, had shown  him a whole new world, a dazzling place that seemed far from the muddy tracks between towns and  the flashy performance that filled every other waking moment. In this world, there were beautiful  young men instead of bossy older sisters; dozens of strange faces to observe each day instead of the  five he had memorized years ago; and stable, stationary canvas booths instead of rolling wagons with  no home. There was only one thing about the old world that he actually liked, the collecting money  part of the show, and the new world seemed to have that part all the time! That was the last night  Fritz spent under the wagon watching the paint peel and shutting his eyes against the falling silt.  Early the next morning, before anyone else had even begun to consider waking up, Fritz was  ready to go. He had stowed everything he needed inside one of the now-empty tar buckets before  going to sleep, and now he slipped quietly out from under the blanket and picked up the bucket. As  he turned back to bitterly spit towards the life he had always hated so, Helena sat up and silently  waved goodbye. Fritz swallowed the spit and a sudden lump in his throat, waved back, and trudged  off back toward Riversend.  “Jack” had been called that for sixteen years now. Since leaving his family and his all-too- recognizable name, he’d seen nearly as many towns as he saw in his first twelve years. His dream of  a stable life was no more than a childhood memory, and a none-too-pleasant one. A penniless boy  has very little to offer the world and the world has even less to offer him—at least for free. Jack had  matured quickly (with the help, one memorable fortnight, of that selfsame tar merchant), and he  discovered early on that his Mama’s training served him well in areas quite distinct from theatrical  performance; for about fourteen years now he’d been making his living as a thief. Agility, speed,  and a sure-handed grace with a knife had gotten him far in the kingdom—both figuratively and  literally, as he didn’t care to stay in any one place long enough for the law or his family to catch up  with him.   The bitterness that Jack had felt toward the family had not faded over the years. Rather, the  disillusionment that had followed on the heels of their estrangement had simply increased and  generalized the bitterness; Jack didn’t like much of anyone anymore. He barely remembered why he  felt that way, but he knew that the only person who really mattered was his youngest sister, Helena,  and that he wouldn’t ever see her again without having to go back to the false smiles, incessant  energy, and incredible discomfort of being an itinerant entertainer. He was in no way inclined to try  that again, and he had absolutely no idea that being a thief who pretended, in well-lit and well- populated areas, to be anything but, was really quite a similar occupation.   Recently, Jack had decided to move from back-alley thievery to a higher-class, more  breaking-and-entering burglary. Availing himself, after long years, of the musical half of his training,  he purchased a few instruments—showing his roots even more—and used his reluctant but polished  performances as opportunities to case rich houses. Never performing more than once in a town, so  as not to be remembered by the cultural elite, he began to amass quite a bit of wealth (for a thief),  and decided to attend a party of movers and shakers at the home of the Baron Orran..."}]}

Curiously, they're both half-elves, he's pretty sure he's a half-elf, too - which puts him well ahead of many of his racial peers who can't decide whether they're elves with human blood or humans with elven blood.  He had a happy childhood, with no more than the usual aches and growing pains.  He got his sense of humor from his father and his impetuousness from his mother.  Both parents are often proud, usually exasperated, and always amused by his pranks and exploits.  He finds paladins absolutely hilarious and will often pretend to be one if he needs to take on an alternate identity.  He's been more or less successful, depending on how much effort he's willing to put into the gag - considering he usually claims to be a paladin of Ahaz, this trick is rarely successful with people who know a thing or two about religion.  He generally expects people to be foolish, uninformed, or simply inattentive, and is often correct.  He steals what he needs from those he thinks have more than they need, but generally prefers tricking them into giving it to him.  He'll put in an honest day's work if he absolutely has to, but it's a last resort.  He seldom keeps what he gets, though.  It's not so much that he squanders his earnings, but rather he is supremely confident in his ability to get more if he needs it again, so he sees no reason to save up.  He prays to Ahaz pretty much constantly, usually half in jest, but also half seriously because he always needs the luck.  The day the god actually answered one of his prayers directly involved a traveling lord, the lord's daughter, a herd of pigs, and most of a jug of rum.  The lord, for his part, is still proud of the assistance he was able to render to the Holy Paladins of Ahaz.  The daughter also remembers the incident fondly, with only marginally more accuracy.  Demaile, who is the only one who really knows what happened (with the exception of some of the parts involving the rum) came away with a slight limp where his foot didn't quite heal properly, an intimate piece of women's apparel (that he promptly lost), and the lord's signet.  He also emerged with a newfound respect for what it really means for Ahaz to answer a prayer.  He considered it a sobering lesson up until his foot healed enough that he could dance again, at which point he decided that it was, instead, an exciting lesson, and he has been a devoted follower of Ahaz ever since (as much as he is devoted to anything).  He keeps the lord's signet and uses it the way most other clerics would use a holy symbol.  It also comes in handy if he needs to forge something official-looking, so that's nice, too.  Of course, if you ask him his history Demaile won't tell you any of this.  He'll tell you something involving dragons and orphans, and perhaps a dark ritual gone awry, a quest for vengeance, or whatever else suits his fancy.  If he considers you interesting or important enough, he might even tell you the same story the next time you ask him, but probably not."}]}

Eli doesn't know her parents. She was left at the Monastary of the Blooming Dagwood when she was three or four – the monks aren't even really sure, just that this small girl was left with only a note bidding them to raise her, and a small necklace with a a pair of simple steel rings – wedding bands with no obvious clue as to the owners.  They, being monks, of course took her in and started raising Elisa Warsong, a girl with a quick grin and easy humor, that gave everyone a good boost of energy. She lived there until she was seventeen, learning how to craft tools from the wood of the orchards of dagwood that were always in season, helping with tasks, and being the youngest member of a community that normally took people in at the age of sixteen. That was when Rieta came into her life – a Tiefling woman clad in a travellers cloak and the clothing of a scholar, not there to commit herself to the celibate teachings of the Blooming Dagwood monks, but to learn from them, and perhaps, should she make a mark on the Monastary, commission a wand made of Dagwood for herself. Eli delighted in someone so close to her age being in the cloister. She and Rieta spent all of their free time together – and eventually a romance blossomed between them, a secret one that was eventually revealed. Rieta's welcome was withdrawn and Elisa was given a choice – go with Reita and leave the only home she'd ever had, or stay and renounce this newfound love. She left the next morning, with a carved dagwood charm on her necklace, and a strong bo strapped to her back, and her hand in Rieta's.  They found a small village to settle in, and a small house with two stories and a modest basement for Rieta to practice her magic in.  Life is good for a good few years. Eli stays around the village, helping whereever she can.  Rieta travels at times, always yearning for more knowledge, more understanding of the world and the arcane powers she could wield. She always came back through. And then when Elisa was 25, Reita started spending more and more time in the basement. She'd had to go downstairs more often than not just to get Reita to come upstairs for dinner. Something was wrong but whenever Elisa approached it, she'd be shut down, and for fear of starting arguments with the only family she had, she never pushed it. For years later, she'd wish that she had. Reita locked herself away for two days straight, and Elisa could hear a racket downstairs. She went downstairs to investigate and found Reita in a pitch black basement save for a few candles, and a glowing purple circle etched into the dirt. Elisa tried to stop whatever spell Reita was casting that sent chills down Eli's spine, but she was thrown back into a pillar of the basement and crumpled into an unconcious heap. When she woke up, the basement was empty – and flooded with sunlight. The house above was halfway destroyed (her most beloved belongings miraculously survived) and when she staggered up the stairs – so was most of the town, a scarred circle of ash and smoke where friends she'd known for years once lived. There were no other survivors – or at least, none that she could find. No bodies, either. Everyone she had known had presumably fallen victim to this dark magic Rieta had fallen into the thrall of.  That was the day Eli swore to herself she would get stronger. She would get stronger so that noone else would die depending on her the way that ruined town did. And so if she ever crossed paths with Rieta, she would be prepared. She now travels, aiming to help as many people as she can."}]}

Its form is maintained through the collective psionic effort of the githzerai who live there.  All who have glimpsed enlightenment are welcome there, even githyanki who are normally the githzerai’s sworn enemies.  As a result of the way Arsanith is constructed and formed, it is impossible for creatures to hurt or harm each other within its limits.  It was constructed such that, if someone were to overcome the anti-harm spell placed on the city, the entire city would collapse into itself and become absorbed in the chaos that surrounds it.  In any case, overcoming that spell would be extremely difficult.  There is a similar prohibition on using psionic effects to control another’s mind unwillingly, although this can be bypassed by members of the Arsanith leadership on occasion. Ezhelya’s fellows were training from childhood to be fighting monks, mystics, or symbiotes, learning to make use of their psionic abilities to fight effectively without armor or weapons.  When their training was complete, they would leave the monastery and form bands to roam the planes and kill illithids and githyanki.  The prescence of githyanki in Arsanith made this something of a contradiction, but githzerai do recognize that there is variation among individuals within a race and considered the githyanki in Arsanith worthy of their respect. Ezhelya was a rare Githzerai born with a complete inability to use psionic powers, so she could not train in the usual gith classes.  At age eight, she met and became enamored with an old warrior, Cordelia, who had abandoned her calling to come study at Arsanith.  Inspired by Cordelia, Ez decided that learning to fight with heavy armor and a sword would be the best way to make up for her lack of psionic talent.  Cordelia cautioned her that the path of a fighter could lead to much bloodshed and suffering, but Ezhelya was stubborn and could not be swayed. As the young gith began monk training, Ezhelya worked on her own to develop her physical strength.  She found an old, beaten up sword and shield in the back of a storeroom, and trained to fight with those.  There was no armor anywhere in the monastery, so she sewed rocks and bits of metal into her clothes and put them in her backpack to practice fighting while carrying heavy loads. At age 15, the leaders at the monastery decided she had proven herself enough to merit crafting a suit of scale armor for her, as well as a new shield and sword. About a year after that, January Szclainski showed up at Arsanith.  January was an Illithid who, for some reason, turned out to not be evil like most Illithids are.  She thought going around to do evil stuff was boring and wanted to learn about the various races and cultures of the planes instead.  She left her Illithid colony at age 10 and came to Arsanith at age 13 (Equivalent to age 16 in human/gith years).  She wanted to learn more about githzerai due to their relationship with illithids. She knew she wouldn’t be welcome in most githzerai communities due to their well-known hatred of “mind flayers,” as they call illithids.  But she figured they’d let her live at Arsanith if she could convince them she had glimpsed enlightenment—if githyanki could live there, why not her?  Her plan worked, although she had to keep stunning people who were trying to kill her for awhile before they realized she wasn’t evil.  After that, convincing them that she was enlightened wasn’t too hard. Ezhelya got to know January better than any other githzerai during those two years.  Possibly because she was already different, she found herself drawn towards people who were even more “outsider” than her.   For whatever reason, she and Jan became good friends. One years later, Jan decided it was her time to move on.  Ezhelya was 17, almost at the age when she would leave the monastery anyhow.  She had kind of a crisis at that time—she suddenly realized that devoting her life to killing githyanki and mind flayers just wasn’t what she wanted to do.  She had learned so much about other worlds from January and she wanted to go out and see them for herself, not as a fighter but as an explorer.  She also realized that she was in love with January and didn’t want to be separated.  So she confessed her love to January and asked to leave Arsanith with her, a year before she was meant to.  January was like “cool sounds good to me”  They moved to the Kapisi civiliation and started a bakery.  They lived happily as a couple for about a year and a half.  Romantic love was kind of an alien concept to January but she was party chill about it and they made it work.  January baked bread that she sold to the townspeople.  Ezhelya felt kind of aimless during this time.  The only thing she knew was that she wanted to be with January and do whatever January did.  She helped Jan at the bakery and learned a bit of baking.  She took odd jobs around the village, as much for the learning experience as to make money.  She kept practicing fighting, but not in the driven, single minded way she had before she met January.  It was just something she was good at, a skill she might be able to use later. To be continued… "}]}

Most of her early childhood she lived in the city of Yartar under the care of her father, a travelling bard. Due to her fiery appearance and equally fiery temper, she often found her way into trouble. To avoid any further scrutiny, her father decided to take her with him on his travels. During this time she became skilled in the art of entertainment (singing, fire-eating and juggling being her main acts) and their joint act (called The Wailing Sirens) never failed to impress their audience. However, her father grew old and weary of their travels and was forced to retire to a farm in Red Larch. With her solo act she struggled to make ends meet. Then one night, after a performance, she was approached by a dwarf called Brolin and ask to join him and his gang of seemingly shady individuals at their table. After watching her perform, they figured her skills would come in handy for their gang, known as the hand of Yartar. All through the night they shared stories of their mischievous deeds and all of the coin that they had made. And after a full night of drinking together, she decided to join them. After a couple of years, she built up quite an impressive reputation in the guild with her excellent thievery skills. Then one day, she was sent on an important mission to collect a great treasure, the mummified hand of a renowned saint. However, before they were able to deliver the treasure, Brolin mysteriously disappeared with the item still in his possession. Returning alone and empty-handed was not received well by the thieves' guild to say the least. However, instead of killing her, they decided to exile her instead.

His father, a well respected elf ranger by the name of Lord Ellannan the Ranger, and his mother, a human ranger in a small town by the edge of the elves’ territory who was called Gurthana Serpenthelm, met in the woods whilst doing various tasks. Gurthanna was out hunting, and Elannan was scouting out new territory for the elven king. They both saw each other, but under the canopy of the trees it was dark, and even though they both had vision accustomed to these environments, they failed to realise they were of different races. They spoke for a time, neither realizing that something had fallen over them. Perhaps it was their tiredness, or something far more sinister in the woods… Nevertheless, they loved each other very much, that night. They decided to sleep out in a hunting lodge. By the time they arrived, they were both tired, so they didn’t bother with lighting a candle, or the fire. Instead, they both crawled into bed, and made love. In the morning, however, Elannan woke up, and, realizing what he had done, killed himself. Took his hunting knife, and stabbed himself twice in the gut, and once in the chest. He bled out on the floor. Gurthanna woke up minutes later, and saw Elannan lying on the planks, dead. His hair had fallen over his ears, and Gurthanna, blinded by grief, still didn’t realize that he was an elf. She fled the cabin, and ran back to town. She concealed her grief well, though some people notice a slight change in her behaviour. She had stopped going out into the woods to hunt, and stayed at home for longer periods of time. 8 months later, Keagan was born. His elvish blood wasn’t apparent at first, but by the age of 5 his ears were more pronounced. His mother tried to hide him from the village, but it was inevitable that he would venture outside. By the age of 11, his mother had great trouble, keeping him inside. It was also at this age that he began getting far more elegant and graceful than any pureblooded human. When Keagan turned 14, he snuck outside for the first time. He became quite good at this, eventually. By the age of 15, it was apparent to even him that he wasn’t fully human. He decided to keep this a secret, though, and wove a net of lies, and made a mask of naivety. These skill would help him later in his life. By the age of 17, Keagan took up fencing and knife throwing to pass the time. Eventually, he bored of fencing imaginary opponents, so he bid his mother farewell. But, instead of doing this verbally, he snuck out in the dead of night, leaving a note for his mother to find. He wore his cloak with the hood up, to conceal his face, and slouched slightly to conceal his height. He took only his rapier and kunai. He travelled East, with no destination in mind, following the road. He kept following it as it grew wider, a sign that he was getting closer to a larger city. It was here that he put his disguising abilities to the test. He came upon a caravan, and was trying to pass it, when the owner ran up to him. The owner had seen Keagan’s sword, and needed some more guards on the caravan. Keagan declined at first, but the owner offered him a large sum of gold. He accepted, if only because he needed the gold. They were a few hours from the city when bandits attacked. Keagan had dismounted his horse to give it some rest, and when the bandits attacked, his horse bolted. Keagan dove into the bushes, to avoid incoming crossbow fire, and snuck towards the bandits. There were five of them, and only one of him. All the other defenders had been shot full of crossbow bolts. As the bandits drew near, he silently grabbed his kunai, and unsheathed his sword. Once the bandits drew level with Keagan, he threw his kunai. It hit the lead bandit straight in the chest. He charged out and fell a second with a quick slash to the throat. His speed and stealth allowed him to stab a third, before the remaining two realised what was going on. Keagan retrieved his kunai, and ducked under a swing. The bandits had maneuvered so one was on his left, and one on his right. He parried a blow from the left, and staggered as the flat of a sword hit him in the chest. He thought quickly, as he stumbled backwards, and then he threw himself backwards. He clutched at his chest, feigning pain. The bandits inched forwards, eager to finish him off. Quick as lightning, Keagan’s hand flashed out, throwing his kunai. It missed. The bandits followed it with their eyes. Seconds later they were both dead, easily dispatched with a few blows from a chakram Keagan had found on a corpse he had fallen next to. Keagan tore a few strips of cloth off a bandit’s shirt, and wrapped his left hand; the chakram had cut him when he swung it. He never took those strips off, keeping them as a memento of his first kills. He realised that as a half-elf, he would never fit in, and he loathed that fact. He realised he enjoyed killing these men, then shook his head. He must stay true to what his mother taught him. Only kill when necessary. But.. Keagan decided to put this moral dilemma off for the moment. He spoke with the owner of the caravan, who was very grateful, and they continued onwards. Once they reached the town, Keagan received his pay. He decided to stay in town for a while. There he stayed, honing his skills of stealth and deception, mastering the art of killing by being an assassin. He did this for 3 years, then set out for the coast. He hoped to get an overseas mission, and see the world. When he arrived, he attempted to resume work as usual. A few months later, he was approached by the mercenaries’ guild. They wanted him to be part of the guild, As a medium ranking agent. He accepted, on the terms that the guild would provide for him, at least in the city, and also pay him a small salary. Soon after he joined, he was given his first mission. It was to go see an old man by the name of Jacel, and assist him in his goal."}]}

Well, I’ll tell you. When she was but a wee lass of 9 (or, y’know, whatever age a half-elf would mentally be 9 at) when the one major tragedy she’s ever experienced so far happened. Aria had a brother, the key word here being “had”. One day they were playing in a meadowy clearing at the edge of the woods that surrounded her small home village of Parsits, when the neighborhood bully, Fritz, and his cronies showed their disgusting faces. They started mouthing off some racist bullcrap at the siblings about being half-breeds or whatever, and then started a fight with her brother. Things got a bit too intense, and since her brother had studied some spells, he attempted to use magic on Fritz. The spell backfired horribly, and when the dust cleared, her brother laid in a still, lifeless heap where he had once stood so determinately only moments ago. This was the only tragedy in her life because what could possibly hurt her more than seeing her brother, her friend and protector, suddenly go from living to dead in a puff of smoke right before her very eyes.

Perhaps it is true that Magho misread some sections of the Book of Proverbs from which he loves to quote (being illiterate tends to have this effect), but he genuinely believes it's the thought that counts.  And Magho's original thoughts can probably be counted one hand (or at least they could, could Magho count that high).  When he was just 7 years old, Magho's tribe returned from raiding a nearby settlement.  As part of their raid, after took all the loot, they burned everything they deemed as useless, including a mage's pouch of hundreds upon hundreds of valuable magical scrolls.  When the fire was lit, the arcane energy erupted.  Although nobody was killed, Magho was flung from the blast into a boulder.  When he awoke, dazed and confused, he picked up one of the scrolls and he saw a light turn on in front of him.  Perceiving this as a sign, Magho believed he just witnessed a spiritual calling.  (The light he saw was a prestidigitation cantrip triggered by one of the scrolls.) Astounded at all this, he began to closely observe his surroundings and discovered a scroll from the explosion.  Magho knew this paper contained the key to understanding life, the universe, and everything.  It was a blank sheet of parchment.  From then on, he studied this scroll of knowledge instead of  going out and fighting with his friends, until he turned 12.  Magho was exiled from his tribe on his 12th birthday.  It is tradition in his tribe that to become a man at this age one must enter into a battle with the tribe's chieftain.  Upon entering the Ring of Valor, Magho sat cross-legged in the dirt and began reciting his learnings. \"The short story of our lives is a story made of untold endings and forgotten beginnings;  He who fights first is the one who is going to show tonight without their best hat;  Little things are small, so are smaller things.\"  The tribe looked around at each other in disbelief, and soon rose up, cried out for his name never to be uttered by another tribesman ever again and exiled him with none of his belongings.  After months of traveling by foot through the deserts and the plains, Magho came upon a group of three hairless men wearing dresses.  They were sitting in a circle with their eyes closed on the ground.  After observing them from afar for a few hours, Magho caught sight of an ogre from this corner of his eye.  It was in flight! As it descended towards the men, Magho picked up a long branch from the ground, charged it, leapt off a rock, and dashed out its brains with one miraculous swing.  The men broke their trance and saw the aftermath of what transpired.  Grateful as they were to have been saved from the ogre magi, they granted Magho rest at their monastery.  Mistaking their kindness for an invitation to join their order, Magho never left.  He spent the next 20 years sitting by them side-by-side, paging through books of proverbs,  hearing lectures about Ogmha, God of Knowledge, and learning virtually nothing.    As the monastery got older and the monks went their separate ways, Magho decided to venture out into the world himself to spread knowledge wherever he could in order to please Ogmha."}]}

His father Tasgall was a ranger and member of the Pathfinder Society and his mother Apirka was a cleric of Gozreh. As a child Addrir was very withdrawn and often had trouble socializing and fitting in to any particular peer group.  His parents were killed by soldiers of Ruthazek while they were out in the forest east of Nantambu. Addrir was only six years old when he learned of the death of his parents. After they died he went to live with his uncle Ailig on the outskirts of Nantambu. Addrir enjoyed being out of the city center and more immersed in nature. Ailig was a druid and while began to teach Addrir about nature and the ways of the druid, he also suffered greatly from a personality disorder that would cause him to fluctuate between periods of great anger and periods of quiet withdrawnness. At his worst in the periods of anger he would take it out on anyone around him, and living in isolation this was often Addrir. Addrir was often physically and mentally abused by Ailig. Even with all the abuse Addrir was fascinated by the ways of the druid and he put up with it to learn more about the druids path. Over time the abuse really began to wear at Addrir and he felt he knew enough to make it on his own. After living and training with his Uncle for three years Addrir decided to leave.  His dislike of the large city atmosphere and love of nature led him to run away into the forest of the Mwangi Expanse. Addrir had always had an affinity for nature and training as a Druid had sparked something inside of him. He survived in the forest alone living off the land for a while until disaster struck. One day while Addrir was out foraging for food he saw a small contingent of Ruthazek's soldiers and was seen by them. He attempted to escape, but was caught and beaten within an inch of his life and left for dead, unconscious and bleeding in the middle of the forest. Shortly after the departure of the soldiers a great breeze began to blow in the area and storm clouds rolled in. There was a great thunderstorm and a lightning bolt shot down from the sky and struck Addrir in the middle of the chest, but instead of killing him it transported him to a timeless place where he communed with the deity Gozreh. Addrir surrendered his old life and accepted the blessings and new life from Gozreh and was returned to his body in the forest fully healed and newly adorned with a tattoo of a leaf with a large water droplet falling from it covering a large portion of his back.  After waking Addrir was approached by a pair of Elven rangers of the Kallijae tribe who wittnessed the whole event. They were at first content to let him die as they generally regard humans as meddlesome and linked to trouble. However the elves knew and respected Gozreh and saw the dieties divine intervention on the part of Addrir. This softened their opinion of him considerably. They took him back to the elders of the Kallijae tribe and explained what happened. Addrir was permitted to stay with the elves. He had much in common with them and learned vast amounts about the natural world under their tutelage. Slowly over time Addrir discovered new abilities he had access to since his encounter with Gozreh. However old habits die hard and Addrir's predilection for not fitting in reared its head again, exacerbated by the natural differences between elves and humans. After three years with the elves Addrir is over come with a feeling that he is destined for more. Recalling his father's affiliation with the Pathfinder Society Addrir bids farewell to the elves and heads to the Pathfinder Society Lodge and seeks membership. Addrir desires to travel far lands and learn more about the natural world. The local head of the Pathfinder Society was a good friend of Addrir's father and remembered Addrir as a small child. At this point Addrir is too young to become a full fledged member of the Society, but is permitted to help out where he can for food and shelter and to begin light training to prepare him for a life of travel and adventure. After living at the lodge for three years Addrir is offered a chance to go to Avistan by ship to assist with a mission the Society is conducting. Upon reaching Avistan the party encounters a great storm that shipwrecks them in the Mushfens. They are discovered and attacked by Varisian wanderers. Addrir manages to escape, but he is alone again, this time on an unknown continent.  Addrir recognizes many similar natural patterns in Varisia. Many things are the same but many are also very different. Addrir begins exploring The Sanos Forest and venturing further in to Avistan to see what is out there. "}]}

Her mother was forced by the brothel owner to give up her child, but no one was willing to take her until her mother came across the Temple of Giggles.  The Temple of Giggles was happy to take her, but not all was as it seemed. To the outside world the Temple of Giggles was a fun loving, frivolous church that worshiped gnomish gods. From the inside it was a cult-like following of people who wish to be whisked away to the plane of Bytopia. Their rituals often involved hallucinogenics and they would indoctrinate new people by infecting them with Crackle Fever.  Aria grew up believing that fits of spontaneous laughter was the norm. When she was young she would often break into forced laughter at unpredictable intervals, trying to make herself like the others devotees, but as she got older she only broken into a nervous laughter to keep the other churchgoers from interrogating her.  Aria found her passion in translating and transcribing the gnomish scripture into common script, but that passion delved too deep and she began to pray to Deneir in secret. She was caught praying by her mother – who chose to undergo indoctrination so that she might be able to spend more time with her daughter – and recognized the risk when Jenora threatened her for worshiping the gods that forsook them.  The Temple of Giggles managed to summon a Deva in the hopes that it would of spirit them from the mortal world to Bytopia, but the angel decided to only take Aria who didn't worship the plane nor the gnomish gods that reside there.

Due to his parents, he had mostly human features, except for two obious details: his elvish ears and his grey skin. Often bullied by other children and neglected by the owners of the orphanage, Orrin had to adapt to survive his childhood. He learned to get his hands on what he needed even when others wouldn't give it to him, either through guile or charm. Quickly he left the orphanage to try and live on the streets of the slums, where he developped a sense of street smarts, by looking at cheating merchants or the thieves that operated on the streets. He never got the respect others did, though: his grey skin and elfish ears in a human city always got him the ridicule of others, always calling him a grey rat. Especially elves and particularly one or two drow that passed him looked at him with disgust.  As such, he's developped a disgust for those who look down on others too, and he finds it necessary that those people will meet him at the same level: if a noble can be humiliated, he will be humiliated!  When he works in a tavern at day, he's being tripped or laughed at. Usually those same people would find themselves with a strange liquid in their drinks, causing their bowels to break all food in the process of being processed. The local Thieves Guild, the Sons of the Traveller, did notice his skills and recruited him: from that moment on, Orrin had better protection and became more bold, robbing the houses of the very lords laughing at him or the other unfortunate souls on the street. What was meant as an insult become a badge of pride: The Grey Rat has visited you! This became more symbolic to him when he found Jester: a rat, slightly bigger than normal, whom he trained and kept as a pet.  With his help, the thieves guild took on some very bold heists, stealing the signature ring of the head of the merchant's guild, sabotaging the guardhouses throughout the city and, most notably, stealing the sacred book of Onatar, the god of craft. This, however, earned them too much infamy in the eyes of the nobles and merchants: in their next heist, they were betrayed by some of their contacts. They lost two leaders, and were forced to leave Eswick. They decided to move their enterprise elsewhere, and start over with the gold and contacts they had left, but in order to move inconspicuously, they travel seperatly until they reached their new city.

This halfling rogue possesses a fascinating past."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Twilek was born to Jard and Lily Gronleaf, nomadic gypsy halflings, on the 7th of Neth. The colourful displays and residual magic of the month's feast days to Nethys would have a permanent affect Twilek didn't unlock until much older. They travelled the Varisian deserts and plains, usually stopping in villages or towns or camping close to Shoanti tribes for safety without interfering and angering them. Lily was an entertainer by trade as well, adept in a multitude of performances whereas Jard provided for the family as a travelling merchant, able to buy most supplies and hunting or crafting whatever else.  Twilek was the second son, 5 years after Imiko and 2 before his sister Irlana and another 3 years before twin brothers Radu and Nicu. All of them shared their rust-brown hair yet their eyes were all different, apart from the twins' grey irises. It was impossible to tell Radu from Nicu and they enjoyed pulling pranks and blaming it on the other.  Life on the road was hard and after the twins were born the family was forced to settle to manage. The closest town friendly to halflings was Korvosa. Imiko was completely enthralled by the ships and inspired by the halflings who crewed them. When Twilek was 12, Imiko left on his first voyage, bringing back meagre savings to support the family. This continued for two years, until the day they received the terrible news that Imiko had turned to piracy.   All of a sudden, the family was ostracized by everyone they knew and business quickly dried up. It took every last favour his parents had in the city to leave the city on board a ship for Magnimar.  ***  Magnimar was not welcoming either. Life in Underbridge was harsh and cheap; Twilek witnessed muggings and other crimes on a weekly basis. He shut it out of his mind by visiting the monuments that gave the city its title and recklessly climbing the crumbled arch bridge. The awe he felt looking directly at history overcame all other thoughts. Arrested for the umpteenth for trespass, one day a curious scholar noticed what she thought was a child in the cells and decided to talk to Twilek. Noting his interest in the ancient artefact, she revealed she was an agent of the Pathfinder Society and paid the pittance for his bail.   She led him to the Heidmarch Manor, which acts as one of many staging points for the society, and the centre of all missions into Varisia. As the centre was being repurposed from a home to a lodge, much work had to be done and he was given the mundane task of re-scribing the ancient books brought in from Absalom. So he learned as he recorded, returning day after day in the evenings, poring over books on every and any topic and earning a few silver in the process.  ***  One day he was rerecording a table of all the previous pathfinders. \"This record,\" Twilek grabbed the attention of his newfound tutor. \"The last name is my mother's and the first name is mine!\"  The tutor raised her eyebrows as she walked over and looked at the record, reading aloud despite the archaic font of the writing, \"Twilek Sigani - Halfling - Trap finding, minor evocation - 4588AR to 4603AR - Venture Lieutenant- MIA after black dragon collapsed tunnels at site 5F2... I'm so sorry you had to read that. Reading records like this at your age...  \"A Venture Lieutenant! No wonder exploring is in your blood. Such a prestigious position... there will surely be another book about him. Maybe you should cross reference the site code and go from there.\"  Twilek had been told he was named after an uncle on his mother’s side, he never dreamt of something like this! He immediately did as he was told, ordering in chronicles of the site in Ustalav, specifically an ancient temple to Lamashtu, evil god of monsters. According to the books, the black dragon was an expected complication, but they didn't expect it to be as old and large as it was. Only two survived of the group of five. The survivors' records depicted various horrors both as frescoes on the walls and combating the very same in the corridors. This immensely excited Twilek rather than scaring him off and as he continued his work he also met with a few high-ranked pathfinders as the months passed.  ***  However, Twilek's enjoyment was eclipsed by the harshness of life for his family. His father's store had been robbed twice and the other kids were housebound for fear of the outside. After just 8 months in town, the Gronleafs were on the road again, following the coast up to Sandpoint. Finally, a place they could be accepted and live freely! Except... many people in town already knew of Imiko the pirate. And so the family were confronted by the sheriff.  The rest of the family stood against the back wall of The Hagfish as Jard stood defiantly against the sheriff, his small size juxtaposed against the built man.  \"The people of Sandpoint won't wait to hear this,\" the sheriff said. \"The family of the famous Imiko Gronleaf here in town.\"  \"Don't you mean infamous?\" quizzed Nicu from the back.   The sheriff let out a hearty bellowing laugh. \"Not at all! Why he's among the best things that have happened to the town! Without his generous donation, my guards would be starving! But see them now in their imported armour and uniforms!\"  With that all the patrons in the inn applauded enthusiastically, and the family was accepted into the town quickly. They moved into a vacant house on Frog Alley (behind 17), and all commenced working, the kids taking apprenticeships.   Two months later, they were relieved to meet Imiko in port after such a long time, yet he yearned for the sea and its adventures, leaving a small fortune for them and the town, apologising for not being with them and stating that he was a man now. Jard accepted this as Lily cried, but they all came to terms with it eventually.  ***  The years dragged on and Twilek had good relations with Sheriff Hemlock, argued with Brodert Quink, conversed with Chask Haladan and listened attentively to Mayor Deverin's adventure stories on the rare occasion. Then the town experienced the Late Unpleasentness, the Gronleaf family grieving with everyone else, but luckily unscathed.   During the rebuilding process, Twilek was called back to Magnimar for training with the Pathfinders and from there, sailed a long way to the Grand Lodge of Absalom. Surrounded by new experiences, purple and knowledge, his entire year in training went by like a flash to him. Numerous tests, challenges and missions later, he emerged victorious and a full-fledged society agent ready for adventure!   ***  With the bounties of the City at the Centre of the World at his disposal, he prepares himself a wagon to live in permanently, painting it brightly in blue with a red roof and stashing adventuring gear inside. Sailing back to Magnimar, upon his return he hears of the opening ceremony that same day and only stays at the lodge to report in before heading back to Sandpoint."}]}

The light offered me a pact, if I would bind myself to its will, it would grant me great knowledge and power. Being a simple street urchin, the idea of power was enticing. This could be a way to lift myself out of the gutter and do something with my life.   I agreed to the terms, and with a great flash of light, I was standing in the nobles house with the tome in my hands. None of my co-conspirators were anywhere in sight. I had no idea just how long I had been standing there, but the sounds of clamouring footsteps suggested I should be on my way with great haste. I managed to escape the nobles house, but not before being spotted and recognised, by the city watch. I spent the next few days escaping the city and haven't been back since.  The tome whispers to me often, mostly just beyond comprehension. Sometimes the whispers continue into my dreams, showing me secrets that evaporate when conciseness returns the next day. But some days I awake and a new secret has lodged itself in my mind.  So I find myself, on the run, with a growing power within. What better way to stay ahead of my pursuers and practice my new power, than to take up the life of an adventurer."}]}

Why am I here? How the hell did that happen? Does this smell like chloroform to you?  Unfortunately for Duane Choquette, the GM who will be putting Lola through the Curse of the Crimson Throne, the fine line that divides truth and fiction gets a bit hazy in Korvosa.  How Lola was initially sold into slavery appears to be a matter of some debate.  Respectable sources have provided several equally plausible explanations, the validity of which have been debated with academic vigor.  There is credible truth to the rumor that Lola talked her own parents into selling her for the sum of 18 coppers and a bag of tricks. It was a pretty good deal by halfling standards.  However, equally plausible is the explanation that a Chelaxian beekeeper found her stuffed in an apiary at the age of 12.  Lola may also have been part of an experimental halfling breeding program to reduce the cost of slaving expeditions. Unfortunately, the program was scrapped when it was discovered that the halfling work ethic gene was inextricably connected to an increased dependency on sardines, which anyone with half a brain knows are prohibitively expensive in Cheliax.  The breeding program was deemed financially unsustainable, and the Chelaxian state returned to the economically sound practice of kidnapping.  It is likely that Lola escaped from the dreaded Chelaxian Turnip Pits through circumstances both mysterious and brilliant.  There may have been a situation involving a particularly lucky set of dice, a tribe of Mwangi cannibals, and a feat of diplomacy that ended with the slavers in a very bad position.  Unless you were a Mwangi cannibal.  In a comparatively likely account, a forged application, a misplaced mailbag and a judicious dose of whiskey produced a foreign exchange program that resulted in a Chelaxian halfling named Nigella landing in Varisia, and a somewhat disappointed Shoanti exchange student named Mofongo who later wrote a strongly worded letter about the quality of dormitories at the Chelaxian Turnip Pits.  It is also entirely possible that Lola smuggled herself out of the Turnip Pits disguised as a pack of wild dogs.    Reliable sources stipulate that three halflings dressed as a Calistrian concubine supposedly arrived in Korvosa aboard the Dread A’tuin.  Lola had the misfortune of playing the left leg.  If you were not already aware, it is extremely difficult to ride sidesaddle as three halflings wearing one yellow toga.  The logistics can be somewhat distressing. The standard explanation includes an exuberant sea captain known as Roberts.  If the stories are to be believed, Lola was swallowed whole by a whale halfway across the Arcadian Ocean.  She purportedly survived off of hard tack and the barnacles growing along the creature’s esophagus.  Only her mastery of the fabled Brown Note saved Lola from certain digestion, and placed her, somewhat odoriferously, in the Korvosan harbor. Credible accounts have also indicated that Desna herself brought Lola to Korvosa on a chariot, dropping the halfling off with three gold, 50 silver and a mandate to do something anywhere but Taldor.  Incidentally, you never want to be Nigella in Taldor.  There is undeniable proof that Lola was chased by anywhere between 15 and 74 men in bath towels down Dyer’s Row.  Eyewitness accounts of the incident vary.  Apparently, this may have been due to Lola’s theft of a debutante’s virginity through unintentionally unique methods.  In fact, the young lady’s misfortune at Lola’s hands - or feet, if the rumors are correct - was due to a well-placed kick so impressively forceful that the Korvosan heiress in question suffered irreparable damage to her reputation. That is, at least, if we are to take the word of El Pompador Churrasco, philanderer extraordinaire.  Other viable explanations have implied a connection to the Laundress, a serial vandal who struck communal baths in Korvosa over a period of two and a half years.  Conservative political scholars have suggested that the Laundress may actually have been a radical member of the Elven People’s Front.  Debates are ongoing.  A third hypothesis suggests a case of unfortunate timing.  On the day in question, no less than twenty-six complaints were filed with the Brothel Owners’ Oversight Bureau citing misrepresentation of Calistrian concubines who turned out to be three male dwarves in a trenchcoat.  The bureau’s monthly meeting dissolved into riots when the coat check caught fire.  “And that’s how I ended up getting chased by the guys in bath towels down Dyer’s Row.  Then I ran into you, and we ended up here.” said Lola, polishing off Diego’s third beer.  He hadn’t actually drunk any of this one.  Or the previous two.    Diego paused to wipe down the mug with a murky dishrag before asking “But who is Duane?”"}]}

The children are both nobles, but for nobles they are rather decent people still. Emman isn't looking forward to the day they decide to leave him, and with the ninth birthday of the girl he's realised just how close that day is getting.   He outgrew all of his friends who were high elves, and now he's faced with a friend who will outgrow him. It's not a good feeling.   \"Em, c'mon, it's my birthday!\"  \"Hm?\"  Emman flinches as he realises he's being addressed, and meets the eyes of the high elf child tugging on his wrist.   \"Yeah?\"  \"Me and Georgie want to know what you think about the new law my dad passed.\"  Emman's eyebrows raise, and he leans in conspiratorially, whispering in undercommon,  \"Which law is this?\"  Music bites her lip and says,  \"Oh, yeah. Um, they haven't told anyone about it yet, but it's um, a curfew thing, for drow. My dad says we can't have a bunch of shads wandering the streets after dark.\"  Emman winces, both at the curfew and the word she uses.   \"I know you didn't know this, Music, but 'shad' is not a good word to use.\"  \"Oh,\" Music says, looking hesitant.   Georgie cuts in,  \"It's like how people call us mold cus we grow so faster.\"  \"So /much/ faster,\" Emman corrects his grammar.   \"Yeah, that,\" Georgie says, switching back to Elvish.   \"So what do you think?\" Music continues in Undercommon again.   \"Not all who wander are lost,\" Emman says, \"and I think your father is just so used to being lost that he assumes everyone else is too.\"  Georgie giggles, but Music looks Emman in the eye and nods solemnly. She gets it.   It's better than nothing.  ---  \"I wanted to return this to Music.\"  He holds up the necklace Music gave him, the one that had been passed down through her family for generations. Since it's a valuable heirloom, and belongs, under law, to Music, the dwarves selected it as her side of their secret communication set.   Music's father notes with satisfaction that his daughter's (hopefully former) best friend no longer wears the prosthetic ears she fashioned for him all those years ago.   \"You really think that after the way you've insulted my family and culture, I'll allow you near her?\"  Georgie takes a deep breath, and lies through his teeth.  \"I know my actions were unforgivable, sir, and in no way do I claim to be deserving of the opportunity to see her. However, I cannot help but feel that Music deserves better than to--\"  The king's advisor takes a menacing step forward, and for a few tense seconds after Georgie stops talking, he genuinely fears for his life.   \"You don't even deserve to utter her name, human scum.  Give me the necklace, and I will see that she receives it. My dear Music may possess only as much life force as your kind, but she is still infinitely better than you will ever be.\"  \"I know,\" Georgie says, and means it.  He hands the necklace over, full of anxieties about this plan, but against all odds, it works.   Later that week, after he's left the elvish region completely, he speaks into his signet ring, reciting a phrase that he knows is dear to both his heart and Music's:  \"Not all who wander are lost.\"  He hears a startled shuffle, and then Music's voice, and relief washes over him as he realised it worked.   \"Georgie?\"  \"It's me. Are you like, okay? Like are you alright?\"  He hears her sigh, and then she says, hesitatingly,  \"Father told me a servant found this necklace outside the gates, by a roadside.\"  Georgie's expression twists for just a moment, but his voice is light when he replies,  \"Your dad is a liar and a thief.\"  “I know,” Music says solemnly. She gets it.   "}]}

He would have been just as happy hanging around town and learning a trade, preferably one that didn't involve too much physical labor. When everyone's expectations got too be too much for him, he joined the clergy, on the grounds that 1) it sounded suitably heroic without involving much danger, and 2) the thought of being a tiefling cleric amused him. He didn't feel any particular affiliation with Bes, but Bes seemed like the sort of god who was chill and wouldn't mind someone worshiping him for fun. Tezelin's plan worked splendidly until Bes appeared to him in a dream and told him to go out adventuring, on the grounds that \"if you're worshiping me to amuse yourself, you should at least amuse me back\". Tezelin wasn't exactly thrilled by the idea, but it's hard to say no to a god who's providing you with magical powers, especially when said god can and will pester you in your dreams until you do the thing. Tezelin isn't really sure what he's supposed to be doing, so he's kind of just falling in with the first group of adventurers he finds and hoping for the best. Or the Bes-t, if you will.

Remember to include his name, class, and race in the backstory."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rhokimira was born to a pair of very forgetful parents. A rare pair, the human and orc truly loved each other and wished to raise their child together. Unfortunately, one evening while her father was at the market, he set her down to inspect a fruit sellers merchandise and forgot by the time he was done. He didn't realize what he'd done until after he'd returned home. Her mother questioned where he'd put her. In his backpack perhaps? Among the pears? Panic quickly set in and they rushed back to the market. They searched and searched but Rhokimira was nowhere to be found. Her parents would never see her again, instead wondering day to day what terrible fate must have befallen their child. Did she fall from the barrel and drown in the sewer? Was she kidnapped? Will she be raised in slavery? These were questions they would never answer. However, the truth of Rhokimira's fate takes a quite different tone. Shortly after her father left the stand, a passing elf named Lurias would see her sleeping form. Lurias was a very intelligent elf, learned in many forms of science, history, and magic, and he was quite aware how half-orc children were frequently abandoned by their parents out of disgust or hatred. He also had a large heart and knew that he could not leave this child to die in the market place. Gently, he took her from her perch and carried her home, whispering assurances all the while. It was with Lurias that Rhokimira, now bearing the nickname 'Kimi,' would grow. Living with the nomadic elves within their forest, she believed completely that she was also an elf, and a young one at that. Her adoptive father, while very bright, was also quite scatterbrained and overlooked the vast gap in lifespans between their races. Though she was much taller than the elves her age, she would play with them and learn with them, leaving her mental age at about 6 years old by the time she turned 21.  Though she was young in her villages eyes, she was strong and insisted on following her father on his trips into nearby towns. Knowing how the roads could be dangerous, Lurias decided to teach her some of what he knew as a magus and a spelldancer. Under his careful eye she learned how to wield swords and axes in defense of herself and her family. At the same time she would learn dances and songs to strengthen her body and spell casting. The more she learned of the performing arts and magic, the more she learned to weave them together to the benefit of those around her. With Lurias and her village, Kimi was happy. When she was 18, however, she was lost again. On a visit to new town, Kimi and her father became separated in the crowd. Once she realized she couldn't see her father, she began to panic and cry. Desperate to find her father, she nearly knocked over a bard who'd been playing for tips on the side of the street. The half-elf, Rhea, was startled by the large crying woman, but held her ground and demanded an apology. Kimi immediately sobbed out an apology and an explanation of what had happened, begging Rhea to help her find her father. The woman in question was taken aback at the force of the apology and the tearful request, but took to comforting the larger woman and agreed to help. Learning that Kimi's father was, in fact, and elf was a surprise, as was her mental age, but Rhea resolved not to press and moved on. They searched the streets for several hours, but the crowds were loud and thick they could not find Lurias. They settled in a tavern for dinner and tried to find the way back to Kimi's home so that she might find her father there, but the elven village had moved only recently and Kimi had never been the best at geography. When they left to try and find the path they unknowingly left in the opposite direction.  The two women found themselves hopelessly turned around come nightfall having attempted to follow a path through unfamiliar woods with the hope that it was simply a very new path to the elven village. They made camp and Rhea found herself once again comforting the scared and lonely half-orc. By morning they'd concocted a plan. They'd go on an adventure! With Rhea's street smarts, Kimi's swordsmanship, and their combined musical talent, they could go anywhere and find anyone they wanted to! And so they set off, travelling for several years and adopting each other as their new sister. While Rhea would occasionally have Kimi act as the unknowing distraction to some of her less-than-lawful activities, She cared for her and made sure that the two of them would be comfortable and happy through their travels. Though they wouldn't find her father, they kept looking as they performed from town to town. "}]}

He had another older brother, but Reed died when Asher was 4 and Reed was 7. Asher doesn’t know the details; all he remembers is Reed being there one day, and then being gone the next. He remembers tears and being sent to his Uncle Rowan’s place more frequently and for longer periods of time. Reed had been kidnapped and subsequently killed in a plot to take his family’s estate. Afterward, Asher’s family was never quite the same. Before, Asher had been pampered and spoiled. After Reed’s death, he found himself either sent to Uncle Rowan’s or pushed aside so his family could take care of business. The twins, distant before, seemed equally less likely to take care of him and infuriated whenever he didn’t take anything seriously. His parents were more withdrawn, seeming only to talk to him when he did something wrong. But despite of that, there was always someone watching him, even if a hired guard. Asher found the combination of the constant guard and his family’s silence stifling. In fact, the only place he truly felt free was at Uncle Rowan’s. Even as he got older, he was still under guard (sometimes even without his own knowledge, which always ended in argument). Asher didn’t like to say that he left home on a negative note, but he wouldn’t say that he left on good terms. His father fell ill a few years before he ventured on his own, and his mother became preoccupied with caring for him. His twin siblings were responsible for most of the estate, essentially running it. The day before he left, Asher had argued with his brother on responsibility, with his brother accusing him of never helping the family (something which Asher insisted he tried but was always turned away). Asher left the next day, saying good bye to his siblings and parents, determined to prove that he was worthwhile to his family and to himself."}]}

The Whitestone Company accepted him, and he trained as a spearman in their infantry. For two seasons, they fought against orcish incursions from the northeast, and he distinguished himself enough to advance to the rank of squad leader, then Sergeant. In his third campaign year, the company was hired by Duke von Schoenbeck, one of the Dukes of Bergenwald, to hold his border against a Duchess with whom a dispute had broken into open fighting. Two of the company's three field cohorts  were tasked with guarding the Duke's own city and its surrounds from encroachment by the opposing Duchess, while the third, including Geirolf, was assigned to garrison the Blackwolf Fort, which guards a pass leading into the Duke's lands. The fort was assaulted by another mercenary company, Damian's Dragons, hired by the opposing Duchess, with vastly superior force. After holding out for four days, the captain in charge of the cohort surrendered the fort to the Dragons, who treated the Whitestone soldiers honorably. Those who gave their parole—their binding word not to resist the occupation of the fort by the other mercenary company—were permitted a great deal of freedom in and around the fort, though no weapons beyond a dagger. A few weeks into the occupation, another force was spotted approaching the fort. It proved to be the Sand Scorpions, a third company with a much more brutal reputation.  Duke von Schoenbeck had hired them to take his fort back...and when, after a few days, the captain of the Dragons met with the captain of the Scorpions under flag of parley to discuss surrender terms, he and his guards were slaughtered, in violation of the Code all three companies were sworn to adhere to. A long and bloody siege followed, in which the Dragons and the Whitestone Company fought side-by-side against the Scorpions. With both companies manning the defenses, the fort was too tough to break, but it wasn't long before supplies began to run out...especially when the Scorpions began using magic to ruin them from afar. After two months of siege, the defenders agreed they needed to get word out about the situation, and the Whitestone Company was closest. Geirolf and a half-dozen other men and women volunteered for a perilous mission to sneak past the besieging army and reach Duke von Schoenbeck's city with the news. Four survived the breakout, and were pursued relentlessly by squads of the Scorpions. By the time they reached the Whitestone outer pickets, only Geirolf and Adya, a woman from the Dragons, remained, and both were injured and feverish. Before they could deliver their message, the tenacious Scorpion pursuers caught up to them, and the Whitestone sentries died fighting them. The two continued on, but were set upon by the last two of the Scorpions within minutes. They were forced to stand and fight, and Adya gave her life to protect Geirolf. He wears her armband even now in her memory and that of all the honorable Dragons who fought and died beside Whitestone soldiers. Geirolf continued to the inner perimeter of the Whitestone camp, where he was recognized and taken to the infirmary tent. There, he gave his message to the company's commander, Elisa Whitestone, who gave the order then and there to start packing up the camp and heading west to Blackwolf Fort. The siege was broken and the Scorpions slaughtered, almost to the man, but all that remained of the defenders were a scant few dozen men and women, malnourished and demoralized. Geirolf was given the Company's highest decoration, and given a place at Commander Whitestone's side when she confronted Duke von Schoenbeck. The orders found in the possession of the Scorpions showed clearly that he had ordered them to kill every member of the Whitestone Company who had participated in the surrender, a direct violation of the contract he signed with them. However, he refused to pay—both the penalty fees for breach of contract and the original contract price, saying that by surrendering the fort, then leaving his city, they had forfeited anything he had agreed to (despite there being clauses in the contract for that express purpose). For this, the Mercenary Code has a clear answer: the Duke was blacklisted for life from ever being able to hire a bonded company again. Furthermore, the Whitestone Company's two remaining field cohorts sacked the Duke's city (mainly the Ducal palace) to make up for the pay he refused to give. Naturally, the Duchess he was feuding with also took ample advantage of the opportunity to take the territory she wanted from him. During the sack of the city, an important incident occurred. Behind a false wall in a warehouse belonging to the Duke, a squad Geirolf was leading discovered a hidden basement that had clearly been used to worship Tiamat, which is a capital crime in Bergenwald. Geirolf quickly pulled the squad out, replacing the false wall, and sought advice from his captain. That advice was to call on the local temple of Bahamut (which they had carefully avoided disturbing in the sack, along with the other temples) to see if they had anyone there who could ensure that the place was made safe for people of good will again. They were fortunate enough that the temple had a dragonborn paladin named Emidhaar resting there on her way through the land, and the next day, Geirolf's squad returned with her to the hidden basement. This time, they surprised a meeting of Tiamat's worshipers in progress, and a terrifying fight ensued. Geirolf had never before seen a clash of magics such as this, and was astounded by the paladin's ability to protect him and his squad from the curses thrown their way by the dark priest. With her aid, they slew the priest and the most obstinate of his followers, took the rest prisoner, and cleansed the evil taint from the place. To Geirolf, the Whitestone Company was never the same after that season. Most of his close friends had been killed in the siege, and his view of the Dukes who were effective rulers of Bergenwald had changed from one of somewhat petty but ultimately harmless distant figures to one of malicious overlords willing—even eager—to sacrifice anyone they viewed as beneath them if it served their ends...or just amused them. He served with the Company for another season, and in between seasons accepted a promotion to and training as an officer. He also began training in more individual combat styles, using a glaive instead of a spear. However, he was no longer able to fully commit to fighting for someone else's gain, and by the end of the season, he requested, and was granted, an honorable separation from the Company. Commander Whitestone herself told him that if he ever wanted a position within the Company again, he had only to ask for it: he would be made a full Lieutenant on the strength of his performance in that last season. After leaving the Company, he sought out Emidhaar, the dragonborn paladin of Bahamut who had aided him and his squad against the Tiamat-worshipers. She was not hard to find, as such people are not common, and provoke comment. However, it took him three months to catch up with her. Once he did, he first asked her if he could become her squire, but she said she did not wish a squire at this time—frankly, she told him that he would get in the way of what she had to do. However, upon understanding his deep desire to be able to protect people the way she did, she did agree to allow him to travel with her for a month and a half. That would take them to a major temple of Bahamut, and allow her to train him in the basics of both Bahamut's worship, and what it meant to be a paladin. If he still wished to follow that path when they reached the temple, he could stay there and they could finish his instruction. If not, he could depart and find his own way. By the time they reached the temple, Geirolf was only more certain that this life was what he sought. He spent the next few months there, practicing both his martial skills and his devotion to Bahamut and His ideals."}]}

This lead to Kava being exiled from her town and family and, to this day, she doesn't know if her parents are alive or not.

She's five foot six, with a long tail, four feet long.  She was orphaned at a young age--so young that she barely remembers her parents. The only thing she has left of them is her mother's holy symbol--a token left over from the Adarre society. Kethra herself is apathetic towards the gods, though she often clutches the symbol when she feels frightened or nervous--or perhaps just needs a bit of a courage boost.  The streets were an unforgiving place. You either learned how to survive, or you died. It was here that Kethra learned the roguish abilities that allowed her to survive, and eventually become an adventurer worth joining the Wasteland Foxes. In addition to the roguish abilities of sleight of hand; insight; deception; persuasion; and acrobatics, Kethra also became a light sleeper who could fall asleep nearly anywhere and a knack for squeezing into tight spaces.  Even now, her upbringing leaves its mark. She refuses to be separated from her supplies, keeping them close, always. She detests having less than twenty gold on her person. She hates leaving places where she has steady supply of food; medicine; and/or shelter. Her place in the world taught her the worth of words, and how much it can mean to be shown kindness--or even just a bit of respect. It also taught her how fast, and how easily, things could change.  Perhaps the most prominent mark left on her is her inability to trust. It wasn't always this way. When she was young, she met a fellow urchin named Lia Anskuld--a Salma half-elf. The two worked together to ensure they had ample food and medicine, and took turns on watch to ensure they got sleep. They developed a bond of sisterhood they promised would last forever.  But when Kethra was sixteen, Lia betrayed her. Kethra managed to evade prison?or perhaps served her time. Now, she seeks answers. She wants to know why Lia betrayed her… and whether it was worth it. And perhaps, when it's said and done, she might want revenge.  (She might also like to discover the fate of her parents.)  Despite her lack of trust, deep down, Kethra dearly wants a family--as most orphans do."}]}

Borba befriends the elderly in the monastery and learns much from their pacifist and nature-loving ways like caring for nature and the weak. If she is not exploring the forest, Borba is in the company of Sir Gregory, her best friend and ex-paladin from the Order. Fascinated with the tales of his life as a paladin, Borba requests that her old friend teach her how to become one too. Under his tutelage, Borba undergoes rigorous paladin training and learns how to heal wounds and wield a halberd. One day, her typical training session goes awry because Borba got distracted with the fantasy of her parents returning. Sir Gregory berates her for this, causing her to run deep into the forest to cry. Lost in her emotions, Borba fixates on the thought of being abandoned forever by her parents. This triggers her innate Orc bloodlust, causing her to wreck havoc on the trees around her. She passes out from the exhaustion of it all and dreams of a mystical Elk that assures Borba that her parents will not abandon her and that they are serving nature. The elk sees potential in Borba as a defender of nature and promises her that it will aid her should she venture forth to find her father. In return, Borba must protect nature and educate others on the importance of its preservation. Excited, Borba accepts the gift and takes the Oath of the Ancients. Before the dream ends, the Elk tells Borba that her necklace (a gift from her mother) will guide her way to her parents. When she wakes up, Borba rushes back to explain what happened to Sir Gregory and expresses her intentions to find her father. Guilty, Sir Gregory tells her the truth about her parents and supports her wishes to find him. When she is 17, she completes her training and leaves her old friends in the monastery to embark on a mission of reuniting her family.

On Ladardon’s 35th birthday a feast was held to celebrate his appointment as Orzammar's newest commander of the Crimson Guard. Ladardon participated in the Provings and was accompanied by Gorim Saelac, Ladardon's second and best friend. On the way through the Diamond Quarter and the Provings, Ladardon met his elder brother Trian and their younger brother Bhelen. Crown-prince Trian, the heir to the throne, had arrogantly demanded that Ladardon return to the ceremony at the throne room at once. So respectfully Ladardon attend his ceremony.  In the throne room Ladardon meet several other nobles, the King, and Kenshin Silverfire. After the ceremony Bhelen told Ladardon that Trian is plotting to kill him, because the Assembly might choose him over Trian, who \"won't step aside.\" However, because of the impeding expedition, there was no time to talk to Trian. The king sent Ladardon, along with Gorim, on a special mission to retrieve the Crest of the Fireforge clan from the Fireforge Thaig. After fighting several Darkspawn encounters, Ladardon finds the chamber with the crest. However, there are mercenaries waiting to take Ladardon out. They carry with them Trian's Signet Ring. After retrieving the crest, Ladardon headed back to the meeting point, only to find Trian’s corpse eviscerated on the ground. As the Ladardon stood over Trian’s body, Bhelen and the King's party arrived. Bhelen claimed that Ladardon killed Trian to become the next Crowned-Prince. No amount of protesting convinced the Dwarven lords otherwise. As an added horror, the cocky scout and Frandolin Ivo, two other attendants, acted as eyewitnesses and vouched that Ladardon killed Trian. Ladardon was sent to the Deep Roads to die, while Gorim was banished to the surface. But Ladardon, being a skillful fighter in the arts of sword-play and lucky, was able to stumble upon Kenshin Silverfire and The Order of the Red Lotus and was recruited as a Warden-Recruit into the Order.  At the Weisshaupt Fortress, Ladardon met the Grand Master as he came to greet Kenshin and his party as they entered the stronghold. After conversing with the Grand Master, Ladardon was informed of the Joining Ritual and its criteria. Ladardon after resting for the night was let into an arena filled with about a dozen or so Darkspawn, his objective was to kill the Darkspawn until he had obtained three vials of their blood. Upon accomplishing that no small feat, he was instructed to mix the blood with lyrium and drink it. The concoction was not the easiest drink to swallow and upon finishing the drink caused Ladardon to writhe in pain and experience visions of the true nature of the Darkspawn – Red Lyrium. Once the ritual was complete, Ladardon was promoted to Warden-Ensign and was taken under the mentor-ship of Kenshin, who would teach Ladardon all he knew in the manner of the sword, which could go unhindered since he was considered dead by the Kingdom.   Many years passed and Ladardon progressed at a steady-rate. Ladardon rose up the ranks of the Order to the point of earning the title “Master”, he had now taken Kenshin’s command, as Kenshin had been promoted to “High Master”. He had run many operations and was a formidable fighter and had earned the respect of many of the members of the Order. He even studied the skill of smithing, and had become a formidable smith in the Order. However, he wished to earn the title of Paragon, and put his traitorous brother in his place, by finding the Dwarves greatest treasure, The Anvil of the Void, and with it craft the first ever Lyrium weapons. In order to do so he left the Safety of Weisshaupt Fortress, after gaining permission, and the underground Kingdom to find the knowledge of the location of the Primeval Thaig, knowing that Caridin, himself, had traveled outside the Kingdom to obtain knowledge for the creation of the Anvil of the Void."}]}

Like most gnomes living amongst their own kind, in his youth he had many names given by many people. Some stuck, some did not. For now, I’ll introduce him as the name he will come to use – Naoise ‘Zapp’ Garrick.  Naoise grew up a very average forest gnome, albeit in a slightly unusual forest gnome community. In the wake of the Starstone’s cataclysmic effects on the land, this particular clan of forest gnomes had found themselves more exposed to the other races then they found comfortable. Cut off from the Sylvan elves they once knew as friends, they had formed an alliance with the halflings who lived across the plains on the edge of their forest. Needing allies to survive, the Garrick clan gnomes and the plains halflings had formed a comfortable pact – both perhaps relieved to be fighting alongside other small folk. As the land changed in the great roil the Starstone brought about, Naoise was born into a forest gnome clan whose isolated patch of woodland sat atop great cliffs and extended into the Hinterland of a sheltered bay – the remnants of the now sea-flooded plains the halfings once lived across. The halflings they called allies had founded a prosperous harbour town, with mercantile ships often taking shelter from storms, receiving repairs, or restocking their supplies in the welcoming – if pint sized - settlement.  The forest gnomes stayed in the forested hinterlands so long as masts of ships could be seen in the harbour. But when the port sat empty, and no big folk were striding about the town, they would venture down to trade and talk with the halflings they befriended. Perhaps unusual for forest gnomes once, this was the status quo into which Naoise was born – but in all other ways his childhood seemed normal for one of his people. He loved animals, and would spend endless days searching out their nests and homes, returning daily to check if they were safe – sometimes stealing food from his mother’s table to feed them. Their underground home was warm and bright, and the temperate forest canopy was an above-ground labyrinth of verdant green and occasional blue sky which Naoise climbed through, gracefully as the small creatures he adventured with.  His parents were loving, but Naoise was in the younger half of his 14 siblings. Never causing trouble, he was a profoundly average boy. Almost boringly so. But the gnomish zeal for life shone through him like it did all his clan, and he was content throughout his childhood and teenage years with the mostly peaceful life he thoroughly enjoyed, occasionally excited by their trips to the halfling town when no ships were docked.  Naoise was 15, and never expected his unremarkably average life to change. He was content, but unknowingly on the precipice of a great change. It was a late summer night, and a fierce storm was rolling in off the sea. The first-of-the-season thunder boomed and heavy rain beat against the gust-battered leaves of the forest. Naoise didn’t know what spell drew him out of his burrow that night – although the wise will recognise fey enchantments when they hear of them. In the thrall of a powerful fey creature, he ventured out into the storm, slowly making his way through the trees to the cliff edge overlooking a tempestuous sea. He remembers this through his own eyes, but his thoughts were alien. Standing on the verge of the cliff, waves boiling beneath him, and shaking with the peal of thunder, the fey creature appeared behind him, shrouded in bright blue light and glowing mist. He remembered facing this captivating creature, held in awe, fear and reverence – utterly enchanted. The fey held its hand against his head, and with an explosive arc of lightning he was sent spiralling unconscious into the furious seas below.  Naoise first reckoned he should have died that night, although has since grown to accept that his fate was in the control of something more powerful than a simple storm. He had been hauled up at daybreak by a damaged ship, slowly creeping its way to find repair in the halfling port-town after suffering at the hands of the same storm Naoise had been drawn out to. By all rights he should have been terrified – he came-to surrounded by grizzled big folk of many races, colours, and degrees of hygiene. But traces of the fey enchantment still lingered on him, and presented with what many forest gnomes would consider a nightmare, he simply took a deep draught of the spiced liquor offered, and allowed himself to sit up. Stood far away was someone who clearly dressed as the ship’s captain – or perhaps not stood far away, but standing half the height of the other sailors. A halfling. A Captain Halfling. At the time, Naoise was still not himself. He answered simple questions, and seemed happy that they were on their way to the halfling port town. The superstitious amongst the sailors thought him a sea spirit, and thought best not to risk upsetting him for fear of ill-luck on the waves. To the rest he was a few hours amusement, and a day later he departed the ship – still fettered by the remnants of enchantment, his farewell to the Captain was as simple as if he were saying goodbye to his mother before she left for market.  It wasn’t until he had made his way home that the final echo of the fey spell which held him died away. He came back into himself whilst sat at his family burrow table, surrounded by his 14 curious and concerned siblings, tearful mother and bewildered father. He cried – finally feeling the terror that should have taken hold of him a day before. He rested for days. And when he awoke, he noticed something that his siblings had been forbidden to mention – a forelock of his strawberry blonde hair had turned brilliant white. Finally refreshed to his gnomish self, he and his family dismissed it as but a quaint quirk. They buried their concerns beneath an optimistic excitement for the adventure Naoise had experienced – and the amusing mark it had left on him.  His family took the unusual step of going down to the harbour without checking for ship masts – their good-natured need to thank the ship who saved Naoise overcoming their terrified reservations of big folk. But the ship had moved on. They enquired with the dockmaster – who told them that as luck would have it, the ship was due to return in the Spring – the town had been commissioned to make some replacement parts in light of the temporary repairs the ship had been given. Whilst his parents seemed pleased to hear this, Naoise felt different. Not anxious, not excited, but vexed. He didn’t know why, but it burdened him.  Months began to pass, and things began to change in Naoise. His old habits lost their appeal. The hinterland forest seemed small, the boughs of the trees less exciting to climb. His smile dropped, and amongst gnomes, this was a thing of great concern. His family thought him sick but he showed no signs of physical illness. Their worries multiplied when the strangeness started. Gusts of wind would surge through the burrow in the night. Candles were blown out. Lanterns rattled. And Naoise became more distant. He would spend hours at the edge of the cliffs staring out to the horizon, or looking up at the clouds secretly hoping for wild weather. A thought burned in him, and whilst he ignored it initially, it couldn’t be snuffed out.  It was only when spring came back around that his family persuaded it out of him. They knew he had been changed that night. And when sixteen loving faces all peered down on him imploring him to share his burdens – he told them he needed to leave. He needed to be on the seas, in the winds and the rain and the salt spray. He yearned for this like nothing before – and planned when that same ship returned, to entreat the captain to take him on.  A wanderlust and need for adventure is not unknown in gnomes – and whilst unusual for those in the forest – they remained very gnomish in the outlook. Excited for his experiences. Happy that there was something to be done to make him better. They all awaited the day ships would return to the harbour with nervous excitement.  It was 8 months since the storm that the ship finally returned. Naoise carried out his plan, although admittedly without much planning. A day after the ship docked he asked to be let aboard – and the sailors who still thought him a sea spirit gladly obliged. He spoke with the Captain – who humoured him for a while. Naoise and his family perhaps never expected his offer to actually be accepted. A rugged crew of humans, half-orcs, and an odd wayward dwarf was no place for a gnome. Perhaps Captain Burrbough saw something of himself in this diminutive aspiring Sailor. He was a strange sort of man – full of laughter and a sense of humour which others struggled to master. Maybe the image of this tiny gnome alongside his half-orc helmsman was too humorous for him to pass up. But arrangements were made – and within two weeks, Naoise Garrick was aboard a ship on the high seas.  The transformation on deckhand Garrick was profound. His gnomish love of life returned twice as strong – his grin was broad, his energy high, and his zeal for the seas near unmatched. Captain Burrbough’s vessel – the Foamrover, was a ship of exploration and trade. Many edges of the map had changed after the effects of the Starstone – and there was profit and excitement for those ships willing to re-chart the seas and trade with the newly isolated pockets of the changed world. The life seemed to suit deckhand Garrick – and he quickly grew into his role. His gnomish sight, and life living in burrows, meant that life below deck was without challenge for him. His days climbing through trees and running along boughs meant he took to the sails, ropes, and masts of the ship effortlessly. He could even entreat seabirds to lead them to land, and after they found a new island doing just that, it seemed his place on the ship was secured. Captain Burrbough liked him, the crew found him humorous. The only quirk was his white forelock – which the crew quickly deduced could predict the weather. Straight, flat, glossy meant clear skies, hot suns. A curl to the left meant rain. To the right meant wind. A corkscrew-ringlet meant both. The superstitious thought this troubling. The practical thought it useful.  The only snag was the severe, unreadable First Mate – the half elf Lady Thalasstra. Her sharp features, keen intuition, guarded mannerisms and forceful presence were respected and almost feared by the crew. And Garrick had no idea what she thought of him. For all the whimsy and laughter of Captain Burrbough, First Mate Thalasstra provided a sombre counterweight. Deckhand Garrick avoided her as much as he could, but on one night during his 8th month aboard, he couldn’t avoid scrutiny any longer.  Deckhand Garrick awoke in the night – the ship was anchored, but tossed around in surging waves. The seamen were arguing as to whether to hoist the anchor – but they were near shoals, and couldn’t afford to drift. Rain poured down and winds were increasingly strong. In the distance, a peal of thunder rolled across the swell. Naoise’s blood pounded in his veins – he was breathless, wracked by adrenaline and a compulsion he could barely control. He had to get above deck. The crewmen saw as he staggered passed them – noticing one thing over any other - his white forelock of hair writhing, twisting and coiling ceaselessly like the dismembered tentacle of some abyssal creature. First Mate Thalasstra heeded the nervous calls of her crew to come see – and she was greeted by a spectacle that left the crew terrified to step out onto deck. Stood amidst the storm was Deckhand Garrick – seemingly unmoved by the wind, streaks of fog rose like smoke from his skin, only to be snatched away by the fierce gusts – facing the crew, his white lock still twisted and thrashed like some wild serpent. Thalasstra stepped out towards him, but before she could get within arm’s reach, Garrick yelped and she was thrown back, sliding along the slippery deck, driven by an unnatural blast of wind. Her eyes widened, and as the hairs on the back of her neck rose away from the skin, she dived backwards. A great crash of thunder seemed to sound from the deckhand’s hands – arms outstretched either side of him as he struggled against some unseen grip. The crew had barely recovered from the shock when his hands were twisted skywards, two great arcs of lightning erupted forth into the clouds. The scene played out for the next half an hour. Captain Burrbough joined the crew in watching as the deckhand’s arms were thrown around like a puppet – bringing with them surges of wind which went unnaturally against the storm, earsplitting bursts of thunder, and flashing bolts of skyward lightning.  The half hour passed, and the storm quietened. Deckhand Garrick was left prone, slumped in a pool of fog which shrouded his form. The crew were spooked, and more than one were ready to end his life there and then – thinking him cursed, that he had raised this storm. Thalasstra, however, wore a characteristically reserved expression. She promised the crew that if anyone threatened their fellow deckhand again, she would have them dragged behind the keel of the ship – and with all the grace her half-elf blood afforded her, she scooped the unconscious gnome up in her arms, and laid him down in the Captain’s Quarters.  Much happened in the following weeks. Captain Burrbough and First Mate Thallastra spoke at great lengths with a terrified Naoise, under which circumstance he learned more about her than he ever thought to glean. She had been born to an elven mother, after a romance with a human sailor. She and her twin sister were raised by elves – and her twin sister showed a profound aptitude for magic. Whilst showing no inclination towards spellcraft herself, Thallastra had sat in many of her twin sister’s lessons, working on her own tutelage, and suspected that the young deckhand could be an addition to the crew unlike any other. She herself had joined the ship under similar desire to Naoise – her father’s seafaring blood nursing a need in her she could not bear to ignore – despite her education and childhood not lending itself to the sailor’s path. Captain Burrbough seemed to take this like anything else – another source of amusement for his bizarre humour, and some extra excitement to match his already exciting life.  Naoise Garrick made a valuable friend that day – and under the encouragement and protection of the First Mate, and with the prompting of some beginner’s lessons she half remembered form watching her twin sister – discovered his gift could do more than forecast the weather. Years went by and with every storm, Deckhand Garrick would stand at the bow of the ship, learning to no longer fear the tempestuous power in him, but learning to evoke it. And with every step further along accepting his newfound power, his other tricks took on new life too. The ship continued exploring the changed edges of the map – and Naoise became an irreplaceable asset. A capable sailor with gnomish charm and optimism, his natural dexterity became athletic. His skin tanned, he became unusually strong (for a gnome). He loved nothing more than making new friends and meeting new people in the taverns of the towns they traded with. His magic progressed – he could mend snapped ropes or torn sails in a moment without any trace – his forest gnome illusions became the standard signals used to carry messages around the ship. The crew would eagerly await the storms to see deckhand Garrick perform a show of wind, thunder and lightning – tricks he had learned to produce even in the clearest of skies, although not with quite the same grandeur. One especially excitable young sailor started calling him Zapp, in light of his proclivity for lightning and thunder. The name grew instantly popular, and Naoise Garrick embraced the new title with a joy true to his gnome nature and their love of names.  This brings up to the present day. We find Zapp decades older – a gnome of over 50 years. He remains short, lithe, and agile, but his athletic build can’t be missed under his tan sailor’s skin. The sun has kept his strawberry blonde hair light – worn pulled back into a messy braid but for his stark white forelock, which hangs loose down the side of his face. Captain Burrbough no longer sails – instead, he commands a whole fleet of merchant ships from a homely mansion not too far from the town Zapp knew as a child. Thalasstra was made Captain of the Foamrover, and unlike the rest of the now elderly Burrbough’s merchant fleet, her crew are pure explorers. They search out the remotest islands and towns into which to expand Burrbough’s trading empire. Zapp remained under Thalasstra’s wing – her initial acceptance, encouragement and mentorship proving the start of a long and powerful friendship. She made Zapp her first mate, and as a half elf in the prime of her life, leads a crew of motley explorers, all of whom revel in the magical gnome, who climbs from rope to mast, with hair which can forecast the weather.  Zapp seems to be leading a fantastic life – always eager to see new towns and meet new people, although one has to wonder if deep down he has a desire to find people like him, touched with inexplicable power. He is loyal to Thalasstra, almost to a fault, but balances out her severity with his lust for life, and hearty enjoyment of ale when the crew makes landfall. He has become adept at a few spells useful on a ship, and otherwise seems naturally able to make storm-like magic. Other than that, he knows very little about his power, and perhaps now is growing curious enough at to seek out someway to develop it further."}]}

Finding that beyond having a quick wit and a few parlor tricks up his sleeve, he had no real employable skills, Goose fell in with a band of Musicians, Actors, Entertainers, Storytellers, Escape Artists, Magicians, and Mercenaries known as the Wild Rovers. Being relatively green and clueless, the band of merrymakers, miscreants, and murderers taught him most of what he knows, and molded him as a person. In this band is also where he earned his famous moniker, as his attempt to perform a daring sword dance turned into a wild magic burst that polymorphed him into a goose, resulting in much leaping and honking as the animated blades twirled around him.  For twenty years Goose roved the land as one of the wild bunch, womanizing, drinking, and honing his performance craft everywhere he went. But he found that no amount of liquor and laughter was able to drown out the baleful chorus resounding from within. Since he was a child, Goose had been tormented by some unknown force, that to him were simply bad dreams or perhaps the result of too much magical exertion. But no matter the rest he had or the control over his abilities mastered, Goose found these dark visions were always close at hand. Having no shape or form, he only knew the presence and the voice that occasionally penetrated the woeful din.  Morohtar… Morohtar...LINGER NOT LONG. THE EVE OF ARRIVAL DRAWS EVER NIGH. HE REQUIRES YOUR PRESENCE.   II. Discovery and Ruin  Around the age of 40 Goose left the Wild Rovers and set out on his own, determined to find some semblance of inner peace. He wandered from town to town, telling stories of the land  and giving various performances for spending money whenever he could. He became somewhat of a household name in the towns surrounding the capital, and after a time began to attract attention. After a rather rowdy show in the Dwarven mining encampment near the city of Oresdepth, Goose was approached by an agent of The Bard’s College nearby. Goose took the invitation as an opportunity to settle his mind and perhaps change his ways, maybe mending the chaos inside.  Goose found himself rather comfortable in the melodic atmosphere that encompassed the Oresdepth Bardic University, but the university did not seem to be as comfortable with him. Other students and bardic hopefuls knew of Flying Sword Follows Goose, but mainly as an uncouth halfbreed magician that thought himself a talented performer. Goose of course wanted only to learn himself better, and cast aside his old ways.   Goose spent years studying the bardic ways in that place, and was soon due to graduate, he would a be a full blown bard! The final performance was at hand and Goose had prepared what he believed to be a stunning mix of magic, music, and storytelling. The headmaster called him to the stage and beckoned him to begin, in front of all his peers. A feeling of peace washed over Goose as he told his story, his past. Weaving spells into images, accompanied by a soft lute that he played.   The hoi polloi, refusing to recognize the talent inherent in Goose, would stand no longer to let such a disgraceful excuse for a bard continue to perform. All it took was a lone voice to start the avalanche, as a small voice in the audience shouted “Down with halfbreeds!” and hurled a ball of refuse at the spellbound sorcerer, followed in suit by a wave of others. And before their eyes the gentle melody and images vanished, only to be replaced by a wild magical field that seemed to fill the room; and the slight, joyful, musician that was once Flying Sword Follows Goose was replaced the by a wrathful beaming entity of hate and destruction. With little more than a glance from Goose, a thunderous boom resounded from the glowing godlike figure, causing the close-by audience to cover and cower as the hall around them was ripped apart by a wave of pure force throwing chairs, books, chandeliers, and bards through the air.   Seeming more like a demon from the Abyss, the jovial entertainer was no more. On ethereal black wings the spellbound entity tore a swath across the building, rending the great hall from its foundation with a simple gesture. Abyssal heat burning in his eyes, the entity’s blackened visage cracked a freakish smile, and as quickly as it came the dark entity vanished, leaving the frail body of Goose shaking on the cracked earth. The Building crumbled around him as the occupants all pointed, aghast, and ran for their lives. Beating a hasty exit Goose left his home at the University and fled the city for the East.  III. The Golden Lion’s Tail  After 15 years away, hiding in the far desert city of Shabal, still haunted by the growing chorus inside, almost moreso everyday, Goose did his best to keep to himself and stifle his wanderlust; when he heard the all too familiar sound of a Northern ballad. Having lived the simple life of a street performer for many years, Goose had learned to speak the flowing native tongue of the East and had dealt with all manner of rough sellswords and fortune seekers, flowing into the city port from foreign lands. He excelled at eavesdropping and pickpocketing, becoming one with the city, and the din of livestock, horses, and northern men were a welcome sight; more purses to lift.   As Goose watched the gleaming caravan from afar, he leapt from his roost in a garden above the city into the street below. No sooner had he adjusted his hat to the sun and shifted his belt, he heard a familiar hiss behind him. “Gooossssssse. Ssssso nice to ssssssee you here.” It was none other than the Yuan Ti Body Trader known as Utszu, a grotesque creature with the head of a snake and the body of a muscular humanoid man.  Utszu was a member of a proud and noble family of Yuan Ti, who used their might and keen senses to enslave lesser races that they had dominated and venture to the port cities to trade them to rich merchants and landowners who wanted cheap labor. Goose was no stranger to these ‘people’ and had on several occasions used a few sorcerous tricks to release the more unfortunate among the slaves right under Utszu’s nose. Although he had evaded Utszu and his patrols on many occasions, it looked like his number was finally up...  Goose saw the way this reptilian man handler leered at him and knew from prior experience that there would be trouble. The Yuan Ti were rare to encounter in these parts, but he had never met one with anything but a foul temper and an even fouler stench. “You owe me coin Gooosssssse. Thosssse ssslaves were not yoursss to take, and you will pay, with blood or gold, I do not care.” Seeing several other heavily armed reptiles behind Utszu, Goose could feel the magic inside beginning to boil up, but he kept it down and reasoned with the lizard. A bag of fine Northern treasure from the foreign caravan in exchange for the trouble he had caused. Utszu’s eye slits narrowed and he waved the sorcerer off. “Ssssundown Goossse, or we will find you.” The band of dinosaurs departed and Goose released the burning, clutched, orb in his fist.  Keeping pace with a richly adorned carriage in the massive caravan that was slowly parting the human sea of Shabal, Goose distracted the guards with wonderous illusions of Phoenixes flying and flaming dragons making circles overhead, much to the amusement of the wide eyed escort. Using this distraction Goose deftly grabbed a loose bag from the carriages luggage rack and began to drift back into the crowd, when a rough voice called out from behind him.  “You are quick lad and that was a fine trick, but you might want to put that back before the clergy has your head” Slowly turning around, Goose was met by a grizzled older man in plain travelers clothes. “Look, with skill like that I think we might be able to work something out and forget this whole situation hmm?” His thick Northern accent blew through the greying mustache that covered his entire mouth, giving him a walrus-like appearance. “The name is Halfdan and i’m the master of The Golden Lion’s Tail, this caravan you see here. And that bag you decided to swipe belongs to the Church of Bahamut, who I guarantee will NOT take kindly to theft”  Realizing that the first good thing to happen in many years may have just rolled up next to him, Goose had flashes of his life with the Wild Rovers and felt the omnipresent wanderlust boiling up inside him. A way out of the grasp of Utszu and an excuse to restart in another place... The stout man who called himself Halfdan held out his hand, “Now I don’t usually do this, but I can tell you aren’t a Shabali pickpocket here to beguile us out of a few holy symbols and a handful of tithings. Hand over the bag and come work for the caravan for a while. Then we might call it even.”   Without so much as a word Goose thrust the bag into the burly caravan master’s hands and climbed aboard the back carriage. Onward, Goose felt that this is where he was meant to be...   "}]}

As such, when a nest of Aarakocra fell betwixt the planes and surfaced on the White Worm's own head - and when, against all odds, one of these unlucky orphans actually survived the ordeal - the brothers took the child in without question. Only the Crying God could have brought such fate to pass.  Hrrikke grew up slightly detached from the other monks, not least due to the suddenness with which his inhuman body matured. He grew and ascended the ranks rapidly as a scholar, but was prevented from mastery by an incomplete grasp of his own abilities. The Aarakocran body is simply not the same as a human's. He may have wasted away his potential, never passing the rank of Immaculate, had an expedition of penance not gone awry, leaving him stranded and alone for forty days and forty nights.  By the time he returned, he had not only perfected his previously shaky martial arts, but also awakened to a primordial form of magic of his very own. The monks quickly agreed: this was beyond their grasp, as a group made - for the most part - by humans and for humans. The young Aarakocra learned best on his feet, without species-exclusive teachings to slow his progress down. They would have to entrust him to the care of the greater Church of Ilmater, and hope that the Crying God would reward young Hrrikke's continued sufferance in the outside world.  Two years have passed since, and Hrrikke - now middle-aged by Aarakocran standard - has received some clerical training, and is considered a model servant of Ilmater. So much so, in fact, that he has been selected as part of an exclusive exchange program amongst the followers of the Triad. Now, he ventures forth alongside the clergy of Tyr and Torm, to introduce the light of Ilmater to the legendary Order of the Gauntlet."}]}

His youth was spent frittering away his allowance on bottle after bottle of ink for what he called ‘poems’, which mostly ranged from mediocre to dreadful. It was only after his mother stopped giving him gold in favor of glares that Bairen began to take life into his own hands, earning what spending money he could through practiced performance. He would have liked to believe that the poetry was what drew his crowds. Alas, more likely it was the brawl that would doubtless erupt once some poor local had had enough of his babbling. The boy couldn’t write to save his life, but he was a fine grappler.  Perhaps he had some inkling of this, which led to his depression as he grew. Try as they might, his parents never quite managed to groom him into the noble sort; though his diction grew more genteel as time passed, his disposition remained as appealing as ever. That is to say, not quite.   By his 30th birthday, his mother had finally given up on bequeathing the Kamelot inheritance upon her little Bairen. By his 35th, his father had given up patience. And so it was that Bairen came to find himself on the battlefield, packed off to a small mercenary band in the middle of nowhere, fighting a small local war he cared even less for than the rest of the world. The letter in his breast pocket told him not to come home until he’d learned to be proud, which confused him. He was incredible as people came, and none knew this better than Bairen Kamelot. His strength was ludicrous; his idiocy, much the same. But his comrades appreciated him, and in time, he came to reciprocate. He had never been trusted before, even to be a failure, but here he found allies who had no other choice.   It was, in his life, the highest goods of his living times; so those last few missives said.  Nobody knows what happened to the mercenaries Bairen first learned to trade drinks with. Nobody knows where his young daughter - Haato, she calls herself - came from. Certainly nobody knows how she got to the Kamelot estate, a year and a day from her father’s departure; or how she found her way inside, past the gate and the walls, to curl up at the foot of her grandmother’s bed; or how she did all that with a scroll in one tiny hand and a letter in the other.  But the biggest mystery of all, they say, is about Bairen Kamelot himself. If he was with those mercenaries; if this is his daughter, as she claims; and if this letter truly is in Bairen’s own hand:  Then when, where, how…  Who or what could have taught him?

They believe that their ghostly blue eyes and their limited telepathic capabilities (Silent Speech) are gifts from sharing the heritage of a Sapphire Dragon who once ruled this area of the Underdark; and in thanks for this, they worship the god of the gem dragons, Sardior of knowledge  A group of adventurers from the Surface (I've taken to the name \"The Primordial Heart\", but whatever works) went on a mission to assassinate the Elder Brain of the nearest illithid colony, and didn't do so hot. They fled, and stumbled upon the Crystalline Clergy, hiding and resting outside of the village to discuss their options; the mind flayers caught up to them, which they figured out when they started seeing halflings dropping from psychic blasts. In the ensuing battle, they rebuffed the mindflayer attack, but most of the village was destroyed. They picked up the first halfling they'd seen fall, and ran, fearing a cave-in  Between guerilla attacks from various other Underdark beasts and simple lack of supplies, they weren't in any shape to take care of their halfling ward, so when they got to the Surface, they made a deal with a local Druid to heal him and their party rogue, who seemed to have gone down on the way out; then, they left to wherever they came from, whoever had sent them on that quest, to lick their wounds and have their own continuing adventures The halfling was nursed back to health, but the extended period of time without treatment made some of the damage too severe; he couldn't remember his name or identity, and he could no longer comprehend Common, which put him in a dark place for a bit. The Druid eventually turned him around to a greater appreciation of nature, with a major breakthrough being when the Druid realized that always taking him out into the sun didn't make him listen - it was night, another of Sardior's domains, that made the halfling appreciate the beauty of the world  The halfling took a new name from the phrase the adventurers had left - they wanted the druid to heal their 'canary in the mines', so he became \"Canary (Temporary)\". He became accustomed to the Surface, interacting with Surface animals, and began returning to books again to get a better hold of more languages.  The sad thing about the Underdark is that it has a lot of horrible things, like Intellect Devourers, which eat your brains and possess your body. This is what had happened to the Primordial Heart's rogue, who had also been left with the Druid for healing; which is why Canary had to fight off a powerful assassin puppeted by an aberration with the help of the old druid; which is why, at the end of the fight, the old druid died, and Canary had nothing to do but seek out the rest of the Primordial Heart. At first, he didn't really know what he was doing - it was just a goal to follow. But, as he tracked them, he started noticing more and more destruction in their wake, and began to suspect that more than one member of the party had been replaced by an Intellect Devourer, in the mad dash for the Surface; and that said devourer may be capable of reproduction.  So that's where Canary's at, headspace wise. Short term goal, hunt down and destroy aberrations nearby. Long term goal, seek out the Primordial Heart, if necessary kill the Devourer(s?) in their midst, and gain closure for everything that happened to him and his village. Life goal, learn every language there is, so that someday, even without the Common tongue at his disposal, he could impress Sardior with the strange knowledge and story of his life."}]}

Remember to include his name, race, and class in the story."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Xandor Undoviel is an elven ranger from Dernall Forest on the island of Alaron, which belongs to the Moonshae Isles. He has been well-trained to fight against the goblin hordes that infest his forest home. As a young man he took on forester duties, but soon after reaching adulthood at 100 years, he joined a group of human and elven rangers called \"The Righteous Arrow\", which is led by the human ranger Dorn Strongbow and which wages war against the goblin infestation, often in cooperation with a group of druids called \"The Sacred Circle\".  Dorn has taken Xandor under his wing and become his mentor. Xandor is also close friends with Thia Siannodel, a young half-elf ranger who is also a member of the Righteous Arrow. She and Xandor may have deeper feelings for each other but have never acted on those feelings. Finally, Xandor has become good friends with Benjen Snowraven, a human fighter who washed up on the shores of Alaron one day and joined the Righteous Arrow after being nursed back to health by the group.  Less than a month ago, Dorn spotted a dragon cultist in Alaron. Intrigued, Dorn followed the cultist to Caer Callidyrr and watched her board a ship to Baldur's Gate. Leaving behind a message for Xandor that promised a quick return but unfortunately did not reveal his motivations, Dorn boarded the same ship to track the cultist to the mainland. But Xandor began worrying when Dorn had not yet returned to Alaron after two weeks, and he decided to search for him. Docking with a ship in Baldur's Gate, Xandor quickly discovered secret ranger signs that Dorn had left behind and tracked him through the Wood of Sharp Teeth to the Uldoon Trail in the Greenfields, but still hasn't found him.  Xandor is an intellectual, logical, quiet person that doesn't easily show his feelings; this can be interpreted as coldness or aloofness but in actuality he has a lot of compassion and always tries to do the right thing. Through his experience in the Righteous Arrow where humans, elves, and half-elves work together against the goblins, and the broader cooperation he's seen across Alaron including dwarves, gnomes, and halflings, Xandor realizes the benefits of diversity and is not biased against other races. He is less familiar with exotic races such as dragonborn, tieflings, and githzerai, as they are very rare in Alaron, but he has read about them and is fairly open-minded toward those who are different.  He wants to learn about the Sword Coast's geography, cities, races, and lore because the land is new to him. In the early morning hours after his trance, he likes to read books about Faerûn's history while the other party members are still asleep. He recalls the maps later with a photographic memory. Within the party, he favors the role of scout: stealthily preceding his companions on the lookout for traps, tracks, and enemies. If he discovers something, his job is to forewarn the party rather than engage alone. When the fighting starts, he prefers to keep his distance from the enemy and fire his crossbow. In battle, he favors a well-planned rather than spontaneous approach. He refuses to kill helpless enemies or torture them.  He wants to help others and make the world a better place. To do that, he feels compelled to continuously improve himself in order to become \"the perfect ranger\". And to do that, he must enhance his skills and equip himself with the ideal items (discovered in books and from other people). In towns he visits, he often asks around about such items. He's also interested in learning rogue skills — not what he considers the \"negative\" ones like stealing, backstabbing, and assassinating — but the \"positive\" ones like discovering and disabling traps and picking locks. These are meant to complement his outdoor ranger skills with similar indoor skills that enable his party to proceed in its missions unimpeded and unharmed.  Around his neck on a leather cord, as a memento, Xandor keeps a fang from the first worg he ever killed. He plays the flute proficiently but usually when others aren't around to hear. He has an idiosyncrasy where he often employs other people's full names and titles in everyday conversation."}]}

Fresh out of the academy, my merry band of dwarves were enlisted to explore some infested caverns far to the south. We were ambushed by a band of kobolds who had been terrorizing a local village, but we beat them back.  We tracked them to their lair and flooded it with water from a nearby reservoir.  Our mission to the caverns ended in tradgedy with the loss of several of our company and without much gain in the ways of stories, treasure, or experience.  Several weeks later we blundered our way into trying to infiltrate a thieves guild.  Without much in the way of deceptive qualities, we were quickly discovered in our mission and an all out war ensued on the streets for control of the city.  We eventually prevailed and took over the local thieves guild building.  We repurposed the building as an inn and trading hub.  This new hub brought many new characters to the town, including a troop of gypsies circus performers with mysterious demeanors and trinkets.    During this time we also sold our services to a local merchant who had been losing shipments to his warehouses to the southwest.  We loaded up in a boat and proceeded to travel to his warehouses to investigate the situation. No sooner than having stepped ashore, than we were beset by giant rat men with swords whom our weapons did little to slow.  We fought our way through the mass of rats to a nearby building, barricaded ourselves inside, and took some time to rest, heal, and formulate a new plan of attack.  With little time, our only option was to clear out the infested buildings.  We foolishly set fire to the warehouses and we did manage to clear out the infestation of were-rats.  Unfortunately, it also destroyed what was left of the merchant's property and sent him into bankruptcy and destitution and meant that we could no longer expect payment for clearing out the rats.  The most significant occurrence is when our band was called back to the stronghold of our youth.  Great earthquakes had broken open sealed tombs in the royal crypts and the stronghold was under attack from trans-dimensional armies.  We returned home and made our way to the crypts with magic scrolls to seal them up.  We entered the tombs and found mud creatures coming out of the walls and stealing treasures from the dead.  A battle ensued in which I picked up the armor and axe of a great dwarven king from ages past.  We battled the creatures and managed to seal the tombs from intruders.  I then returned to the stronghold and, using the appeal of the relics I now wielded, I raised an army to perform a sneak attack  on the besieging army outside our walls.  We crushed their resistance and they fled back to their own dimension.  After the battle though I was confronted by the current king of the stronghold. I would not relinquish my new relics that I was now weilding for I believed myself to have been chosen to lead a crusade against our enemies and to crush those that stood against us.  The king banish our group from our home and we returned to our lives at the inn and trading post and had many more adventures from there."}]}

This warlock character is a human."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The earliest clear memory that Angelica Jones had was of sitting beside the mill pond and watching a frog slowly die. Her mother owned the mill, and the land along the river, in a farming community a thousand miles from the sea. She was the third of four living children, nearing nine years old in the spring, and a child like any other – by turns willful, curious, shy, laughing, angry, or any of the other moods that fill a child’s life. But today it was calm, and she had been skipping stones across the waters when a swift movement caught her eye. A snake lunged and bit at a bullfrog, and Angelica flung the stone in her hands, striking the snake in the side and startling it away. It disappeared in the grasses along the bank, and she forgot it as she knelt to watch the frog struggle. The frog kicked weakly, coordination gone as it bled in the mud. Then it only spasmed, then twitched, and then was still, even when Angelica poked at it. That was when she first heard her master’s voice, a long slow sigh in the still air. Would you burn? it asked, and she said aloud, “Yes.” And the frog was burning, and the grass was burning, and Angelica shouted in alarm and excitement and stamped out the thin flames amid the grasses and the greasy smoking frog, and because there are few things as dangerous as a fire near a grain mill, she had nearly forgotten everything but her fear by the time she ran back, out of breath. The next day she had a fight with another girl, and when she shouted, it was with a voice like thunder, and the fire was there, and that was another set of clothes ruined and another scolding. It grew from there, the growing flame inside her and the damage around her, the fear on the faces of the other children and the worried set of her mother’s mouth as she was beaten. Then came the knock on the door, late at night, and her master had come for her. A woman in tattered black stood on the doorstep, holding her hand out for Angelica. She was tall – too tall, inhumanly tall, bent down to reach for a child’s hand. She was bald, and her skin was a waxy yellow and spotted with age, and she smelled like damp earth and sweet rot, and Angelica didn’t care in the least as she was lifted up and held close. They traveled through the night, through cold empty air and tunnels of dirt, through places that chimed like bells as the moonlight twisted around them, and places where the slightest breath was a shriek. When morning came, she was home. The sunrise revealed an ivory spire, the Sea-Bone Tower, built from the bones of whales and leviathans, the teeth of squids and sharks. It also revealed the first of her sisters, Muire and Tess. They were also students and apprentices here; they hugged her and called her Angie, and made her welcome. Muire was the oldest, an elf wrapped in vines of holly, a soft-spoken historian and mentor. Tess was in the middle, a human with dyed pink hair, a poisoner and a friend. Angie was the youngest, completing the trio as she began her training. The first year was for learning, more than Angie had ever had before. Muire taught her history and politics, the names of figures known and unknown, maths and logic and rules of magic and scholarship. Tess taught her the thirteen classical poisons, anatomy and dissection and the secrets of life and death, blood and pain. Her master visited only infrequently, but taught her to call the fire in her veins and to strike with it. Muire also taught her the joy of reading, whispering softly aloud the fanciful tales of handsome witches and ages of adventure as they lay in bed feigning sleep. Tess taught her to run, and to cook, and held back her hair when she vomited out one of the fouler potions. And at the end of the year, when her master died in the dead of winter, Angie burned the old black rags in the fireplace where they held their vigil and waited for the master to return. The second year was for magic. Muire taught her runes and sigils, binding, cursing, and haggling. She also gave Angie the first volume of the chronicles of Tabitha, and showed her the secret corners of the library where the smutty tomes of dubious historical accuracy were tucked away. Tess helped her carve her first wand, and learn to see the glitter of magic, to tell a ward from a blight, and a charm from a curse. She also taught Angie to lie with a straight face, and helped pick up the pieces when she was caught. This was the year her master first killed her, passing her the bowl of poison and laying her on the table, catching back a piece of her death when that first new gasping breath again filled her lungs. In the spring of the third year, Muire left. They all cried together, and held a celebration with cakes and a far-too-good wine, and swore to be sisters forever. Before she left, she gave Angie a broom bound in iron, and made her promise to learn to fly it, and Angie instantly and forever forgave her for growing up tall and beautiful and swore that she’d only remain a little bit jealous.  Some weeks later, her master left and returned with a new charge for them. Her name was Crane, and she was bleeding and fearful and would speak only a whisper when they met. Tess was the oldest now, and her skills could be turned to healing, and so she cleaned and bound the wounds while Angie cooked and drew a bath, and they learned of Crane’s slavery in the gladiator pits. Together, they were agreed – Tess would teach her how a woman fights, and Angie would help unlock the magic in her blood, and they would make her a great witch and a sister. At the height of that summer, their master gathered the three girls on the slopes in front of the tower in the early morning light. She spoke a grand spell and split open the air to let forth a torrent of salty water and a monster, summoning thirty feet of whale to a place that had never seen the sea. She bade them to kill it, and clean the bones, and prepare the flesh. For three days they worked without pause, surrounded by blood and fat and viscera. Tess brewed potions to chase fatigue and strengthen tired arms. Angie cut and sawed, with blades as large as she was and knives as small as her finger. Crane cooked and boiled and salted, casting wind to disperse the ceaseless crowding flies and throwing gobbets of flesh to the watching coyotes and foxes in the night. And at the end, they drowned Crane in a vat of blood and oil, to separate her spirit as they reshaped her flesh. And for all that they complained of the monotony, few things ever tasted as sweet as the whale steaks they ate afterwards. The fourth year passed in a blur. Crane grew taller than Angie, which was hardly fair when she was a senior witch to the other girl, but it couldn’t be helped. She studied more magic, learning to call other powers through the fire inside her, and to lend her power to others. She conjured with Tess while the other witch summoned ghosts, and she read with Crane, teaching her to study and learn. When her master died at the end of the year, Angie washed and oiled the body, while Tess whispered the secret name in her master’s ear. In the fifth year, for a short time they were four. The master of the tower brought them a young girl, covered in pox, one eye milky white and the other crudely sewn shut. They sat with her through the sickness, bathed away her sweat and cut open her eye to pack the socket with healing moss. Her name was May, and with her arrival, Tess’s smile grew thin and edged. One night, Tess came with her pack of poisons to say goodbye, leaving Angie with a brace of ritual daggers and a promise that they would be sisters forever. And then Angie was the oldest of the three witches. She dueled with Crane on the lawn, swirls and arcs of magic leaping back and forth between them. She sat with May while the other girl learned another sight, tearing open the veils of the past and future. She showed Crane the secret corners of the library, and they laughed together over the ridiculous romantic witches and their adventures, while vowing to have their own adventures one day. She taught May to cook, and May taught her to make tea, and they both fed Crane when she would forget her meals.  They were sisters together, and though she knew she would eventually leave, she loved them. As the time grew nearer, she made for Crane a goad, a wand and weapon and mark of authority all in one. For May she sewed a cloak, heavy and soft and weighted like the warmth of a hug. For herself she made a tall hat, and found a set of tall boots, because she wasn’t going to be this short forever, not if she could help it. And when her master told her there was a new world, and a ship to sail her there, Angie knew this was the start of her adventure. She would be a great witch, and make her sisters proud. "}]}

War During the war, he was sent to the Temple of the Sun monastery as part of a political intrigue involving how to structure the company of men at arms being sent from Caermeirion and the Temple of the Sun. Some of the members of the company owed their allegiance to the ducal family of Caermeirionshire, and others were affiliated with the Temple of the Sun.  Rain was a senior commander in the Silver Company, a group of mixed Sun Soul monks and Caermeirionshire vassals during the end of the war, and Aldren Steelwing was the junior commander. Rain and Aldren have some level of name recognition / minor celebrity from that and from the bard’s song (more below).  Notable Battles Betrayal in the Silver City – Rain was involved in foiling a High Lord’s plot to betray the Temple and the Silver City from within. Rescue from the Mad Wizard’s Maze – Rain was captured by the enemy for several days and questioned about intel – Rain lied to the inquisitors in a way that led to escape/rescue. Aldren and Rokan led the rescue. The Battle of the Seadrake — Met and recruited Rokan of Kanutu. The Battle of the Maw: Rain risked burnout to help his cadre hold the front, and was left with visually distinctive sun-scars on both palms from channeling sunfire for too long.  Since the war Rain’s rejoined the monastery as a teacher and occasional diplomat with a particular interest in mending the harms left by the previous war and ensuring that the next generation of acolytes is better prepared in the event of the next war. In the absence of warlike hostilities Rain takes groups out into adventure-prone areas for training and mending.  Some bard Rain kinda wants to strangle went off and wrote a stupidly popular song about the captivity and escape, and the battle that left Rain with star-scarred palms from fire channeling – not that it’s a bad song, it’s good enough to be popular and memorable, but Rain doesn’t like the reminders.  He’s always taken care to be well-dressed and respectable-looking for both his house and his monastery, but he’s intent on impressing on the younger acolytes that good manners and ass kicking are not at all mutually exclusive.  On a mission for the Relief Agency, Rain is captured by cultists (for the third time) and nearly sacrificed; Aldren and Rokan rescue him, and Aldren spends the next 7 years solid teasing him about “again? seriously? you need to break this habit, it’s bad for your health.”"}]}

Her childhood was not idyllic; she was expected to do her fair share of work and times could be lean if the harvest didn't come through. Nonetheless, she worked hard, even if it was just so she could finish faster and hide out in the fields to write poetry and compose little songs, her true passion.  Her father was kind but also stern, and more than once Ffion found herself in trouble for letting the pigs out of their pen or encouraging the chickens to roost outside the barn (due in part to her conviction they'd be happier free, but she couldn't pretend it didn't make her happy to see the chaos a pig trying to get into the kitchen caused). Ffion grew up knowing her father expected her to take over the running of the farm one day, and his expectations weighed on her. Added to her mother's apparently inability to see that Ffion was maturing like a human child, not an elf, by the time she reached sixteen she had come to the decision that she had to run away.  Still, it took another three years of plotting and saving the pennies she earnt by singing on market days and penning love poems for hapless farmhands before she eventually left home, and even then, it was the long-awaited birth of a baby brother, Rhys, that pushed her to take the plunge. She begged a place in a passing troupe of entertainers, the Lucent Chorus, winning them over with a flattering song and the promise that she was a good cook, and left a note telling her parents she was leaving for good.  She spent the next several years travelling with that same troupe, honing her craft and learning how to draw a crowd and keep their attention. It was also with this troupe that she met the first man she'd truly fall in love with, Hallam Dain. A minor human noble (the fourth son, unlikely to inherit), they met in a tavern when she was performing in Oakengulf, and he pursued her respectfully but determinedly. When the troupe moved on from Oakengulf he insisted on travelling with them, and Ffion was charmed, taking him into her bed soon after.   They spent a year together, but Ffion—young and trusting—didn't realise that behind her back, he was also pursuing another member of the troupe, a tiefling woman called Temerity who Ffion counted among her friends. The two lied to her for the entirety of that year, even making excuses when Ffion expressed worries to both that she and Hallam were growing apart. When Ffion discovered the deception, heartbroken, she left the troupe and went to the only place she could think of: her family's farm.  Despite her fears that she would be rejected as Hallam rejected her, her parents welcomed her home with open arms, introducing her to not only her brother Rhys, now four years old, but a baby sister as well, Meredith. For the first time in her life, Ffion threw herself into the backbreaking labour of farm work, and came out stronger mentally as well as physically. When she left home again, it wasn't under cover of night but on good terms, and to this day she makes sure to visit her family at least every second year, sending home trinkets and letters when she can't be there.  Since then, Ffion has most often travelled alone, though she has many friends across the continent, and more lovers. Unwilling to place her heart in danger again, she tends to pursue single nights with men and women who often have spouses at home, feeling sure it's better to know ahead of time that they can't commit themselves to her than to believe she deserves anything more.  She is currently in Xaphingden City with the intention of performing for the royal family, as she's built up enough of a reputation over the years that there are nobles who will speak for her if she asks.  Ffion has no idea that she has two full-blooded elf half-siblings from her mother's previous marriage. Her mother doesn't ever talk about her life before meeting Hywel, and all Ffion knows is that her mother's family were traditionalists who disowned her for marrying a human. "}]}

She lay alone for almost a full day and night, kept alive by her higher body temperature and some primal determination not to give up on life.  Near dawn on the day following her birth and abandonment, a nomadic clan of gnomes passed by and, alerted by the sound of crying, a woman called Mina Fairsteel discovered the baby. Mina was kind hearted, childless and filled with longing, and saw past Blessing's appearance, seeing only an infant in need of love and a family. She wrapped the baby in her cloak and took her at once to her wife, Teribeth, and the two agreed this child was the blessing they had been waiting for.  Though the rest of their clan was not so quick to accept Blessing, the high status of the Fairsteels meant they were willing to take the chance, and as she grew up into a sunny, cheerful little girl, the whole clan came to love her as her two mothers did.   And grow she did; slowly at first, but it soon became apparent that Blessing would end up half as tall again as her gnomish family. They never complained about Blessing's size to her face (and in fact, most welcomed it as a help) but after one too many incidents of too-small furniture broken, she came to think of herself as big and clumsy in comparison, and to this day tries to make herself small and unobtrusive whenever she can.  Her teenage years came with another challenge. While she remained cheerful most of the time, Blessing became prone to mood swings and her temper was short enough to cause concern. After a bout of screaming rage that resulted in Blessing defiantly and deliberately breaking a beloved heirloom, her mothers decided enough was enough. Blessing needed an outlet for her anger and her strength, and fighting fit the bill in a way nothing else did. She showed a particular affinity for the greataxe, but her penchant for throwing herself into battle body and soul with little regard for her own wellbeing meant she was dangerous with all melee weapons, her fists included. On more than one occasion, merely her presence and reputation allowed the clan to avoid a bad situation becoming an all-out fight.  On her twentieth birthday, she gave her mothers the heirloom, repaired, and received in turn a greataxe, forged and made for her in every way."}]}

She was a fighter, not a dusty nosed scholar! When she came of age, she took part in the traditional Deep Hunt, as all young Tritons did, but she was blessed by a vision from Tempus, God of the Deep. Feloren hunted down the white squid and laid it on the altar to Tempus, and an ethereal tentacle took her sacrifice and pulled it deep into the inky dark. Then the tentacle touched her forehead, and she had a vision of herself as a glorious defender of the temple. When she awoke, she had been marked with a sucker print on her temple, where the tentacle had touched her skin.   Awoken to her duty, Feloren forswore her previous life of luxury and lived instead for the glory of Tempus. For twenty years, Feloren was a glorious defender of the faith, as strong in her prayers as in her mighty arm. However, she forgot her duty for Tempus and drank heavily the night of the Blood Tide Festival, and a mighty host destroyed the temple while she slept in the marble halls of her father’s palace. The next day, Feloren woke to find that she was the sole survivor of a massacre - all Vuuzians around her had been slain by an unidentified weapon, and the temple desecrated. No trace of the killers was left behind.   Crazed with grief, Feloren roamed the seas, fighting all comers, drinking dryland wine to ease her grief. She found no trace of the mysterious sea killers, and had given up hope, collapsing on the altar to Tempus to await her death. The ethereal tentacle returned, but instead of a gentle caress, it wrapped around her, crushing her nigh unto death, and dragged her through the deepest reaches of the ocean, finally flinging her above the waves and into a dryland city. Feloren fought against those drylanders who tried to touch her, until she passed out from her injuries.

After all, his family name was taken from him the same time his family was; the fact that he even remembers his first name instead of just “Cabin boy” is a blessing, although he could be remembering it wrong anyways.  At a young age, his elven outpost was attacked by a band of raiders, who slew his family and took him as a prisoner. He was handed from captor to captor for a while after that, until he ended up enslaved by the Drow pirate, Kirth’et. He was to be kept as a cabin boy for a short while, until they next returned to the Underdark and made him an offering to the spider goddess Lolth.  That return trip took longer than anticipated, though, so he spent a good amount of time on the ship, where he had to learn to steal whatever he could to survive - food to keep through the day, a blanket to keep through the night, and whatever else he could to keep his hopes alive of ever making an escape. In secret, he watched the pirates fight, and tried his best to pick up on their swordplay as well (though any time he was caught doing so, he was then used as a training dummy by the rest of the crew).  One day, however, he did manage to make his escape. In the middle of a raid, he let himself get knocked overboard, and swam to safety as far as he could. There, he washed up on the Sword Coast, a battered Elf, but a free Elf.  One would think that his life would have taught him to be compassionate to those not as well off as him, to compensate for the cruelness that he was shown. One would be wrong, in such a case. For he had grown hardened, and greedy, and after losing all the world had taken from him, he was determined to take all that he could, wherever he could, from whoever he could.  Other people had done nothing to help him; other people had used him and sold him. So why should he care for anyone else? No, other people were just tools to be used, and a disarming smile while calling them “friend” was the best way to use them. After all that he had been through, Yorelin was hard to phase, and learned to keep a smiling poker face in any situation. His time on the high seas among pirates had made him an expert smuggler as well, which he took as his profession. But should his possessions be put at risk, he’d show no mercy nor kindness, and when given the choice between riches and the wellbeing of other people, he’d pick riches every time."}]}

Of course, the caravan was attacked by an evil necromancer and his army of the undead. Traveling heroes managed to save the day, but the  moment stuck with Phyll.  “Why should undead only be used for evil?” he wondered. “Think of all the good they could do if utilized right.”  He realized the the undead could serve more purposes than just attacking caravans and guarding evil lairs. There are plenty of tasks that skeletons and zombies could be put to work at - street cleaning, security, plowing fields, the list goes on.  So Phyll began studying to be a wizard; he was an intelligent young lad, so his family used what money they had to get him books on magic that he diligently poured over, until he began getting a grasp of the basics of magic, with the focus of his studies on necromancy. Eventually, he was ready to head out and explore the world.  Phyll has a dream for the future, a world where the undead are used to carry out society’s menial tasks, allowing a degree of comfort for all who live in it, and the freedom to pursue their passions. In return for fulfilling, safe, and comfortable lives, people would willingly allow their bodies to be used after death as the undead workforce for a time, paying back the society that has provided for them.

Though he seems human in stature and most features, Iorad has a powerful, stout build and an unusual gray cast to his skin, perhaps a hint at mixed ancestry. The lives of most slaves were short and brutal, and Iorad often fought both with the orcs to fend off the monstrous threats in the mountains, and against the orcs to protect the weaker slaves. The settlement was ruled by Rugud the Howler, an orc with some shamanic power. In Iorad's teen years, a party of Bloodaxe Mercenaries from Sundabar found the lost outpost, and battle ensued. Iorad helped drive out the orcs, but Rugud collapsed a cavern, escaping and killing most of the other slaves. Iorad returned to Sundabar, finding work with his immense strength until he was found by Teppers, a halfling leader of a mercenary party called the Death Caps.

While Ollie did very much enjoy study, they found themselves not only wrapped up in tomes of history and magic, but also fictional works of great heroism. The idea of being in the back lines - at best - slinging magic spells quickly lost its appeal, though they dutifully, for a long time, at least studied as their parents asked.  Enrollment into the Lyceum was a given - practically a family tradition. Ollie got good marks, but constantly felt a pull of wanting to do something more than sit among books their entire life. Troubled by the pulls of obligation and choice, they spent much of their childhood silently miserable. They likely would've remained that way, too, if not for him happening upon a duel in the streets of town.  Ollie was utterly enraptured by the scene. The winner dispatched the man with a few clean motions, leaving the thug unconscious on the ground. While most went on their way after things settled, they quickly went over to introduce themselves to the Half-Elven woman who they'd come to know as Eliora. Eliora, a woman recently retired from military life, was amused at this young scrap of a person asking her to train them to be as good as she was with the sword for coin, but their clear drive was enough to grab their interest. The amount they could pay up front didn't hurt.  Eliora would become a good friend and mentor as Ollie proved themselves to be more than just a child trying to play hero. They threw themselves into swordsmanship like they threw themselves into anything - with an almost insatiable drive to be the best at it. Still, having to hide the training created a bit of a double life for them, and they quickly started to find it overwhelming to juggle both the side of them that wanted to be an academic and learn about the arcane and the side that wanted to become the hero they always dreamed of being. What's worse, their parents found out about their little trips into the city to train and didn't take it well. After the discussion devolved into a fight, their relationship was strained to a breaking point.  Refusing to give up on their dreams, they decided to go beyond their schooling - which really offered them nothing for their problem - and visited the local curiosity in town. Gilmore had quite a reputation among students, and it was clear very quickly why. The man was easier to talk to than Ollie ever imagined such a known figure could be, and they found themselves confiding in him what was happening and what they wanted to do - to find a balance somewhere. After considering the dilemma, they went into the back and returned with a book that was as old looking as some of the oldest in the Lyceum's library.  This might be of use, he promised. He hadn't been lying. Enchantment had always been a bit of a focus subject for Ollie, and the book, written by an unknown author who Gilmore could only say was probably from the Rifenmist Peninsula area, spoke of something that went far beyond that. They realized they could build on what was clearly someone's unfinished research on the topic, which they realized just in time for all hell to break loose.  Thordak changed everything. Suddenly they were thrown out of their comfortable student life and he could do nothing but watch it all burn. In the ensuing time between the attack and the taking back of Emon, Ollie quieted the panic of losing contact with literally everyone they cared about by throwing themselves into their research. They realized they could essentially use runes on his weapons, armor, and even body to tap into their innate magical talents. Though the ensuing time often involved failures at best and near brushes with actual injury at worst, they eventually found success. Their training with the arcane as well as their martial training finally found a connection point.  It became their project, their obsession. When it became clear they would have to mark their body to get some of the magic spoken inside to work, they didn't hesitate, even though the Academy would've expressly forbade it. It didn't take him long to unlock the secrets of the book, and he found reason to believe that perhaps it wasn't the only one.  Perhaps there was still things yet to find.  When the Academy began asking for volunteers to go to the corners of the world to begin rebuilding the Academy's lost libraries, they were among the first to sign up, surprising even their teachers when they chose one of the most dangerous assignments - into the Rifenmist Peninsula. It was of course on purpose - they knew, after all, the book they'd been given had been found in that area. With little reason to question their motives, they agreed to allow them leave from the Academy for more...hands on experiences.  They weren't stupid, though. They knew it wasn't a journey they could take alone. When it was clear none of their fellow peers had any interest in the area, they turned to a tavern to see if anyone was looking for a shield while traveling. As it turned out, there was..."}]}

Having two other siblings, one being my twin sister Kariana, and the other, an elder brother of 5 years, Mathias.  We were raised to follow in our parents footsteps among the clergy though Mathias was resistant and I wasn’t too interested.  Our home, the temple, was located in the Castle district of the capital city Orphia. We were looked upon in high regard by everyone in the city, including the King.  Mother and father were always busy in matters of church and state so we grew to see other members of the clergy as more of a family. Growing up, my sister and I were the best of friends while our brother grew distant, and would avoid being around us as much as he could. Often I would catch Mathias sneaking off somewhere and I would follow. He would make his way to an abandoned cellar where he had stacks of books. There he would spend hours on end reading and what seemed to be him attempting magic. One night he caught me as I knocked something over watching him from the doorway, he spun around and launched a ball of fire in my direction, hitting the stone wall beside me. “What are you doing here?!” He yelled. “I-I’m sorry big b-brother… I was just curious..!” I replied as he stomped over and grabbed my wrist. “Don’t tell ANYONE what you saw!” he replied as he started dragging me back to the temple.  The years passed, I told no one about what I saw, though I don’t know why he was so secretive about it. I would often go and hang around soldiers as they trained, and I liked to try my hand at different weapons they had laying around. I got decent at a few but I didn’t quite find anything I was good at. My sister spent her time doing what our parents wished and learned the ways of being a cleric. I studied it as well but I was not as diligent as her nor as skillful.   On the eve of Kariana and my sixteenth birthday alarm bells started ringing in the dead of night waking everyone up. There was smoke in the air accompanied by the sounds of fighting. Kariana and Mathias were nowhere to be found. Rushing out, there was flames and bodies everywhere, but not all the bodies were still. The guards were cutting down troves of undead, yet they kept coming. I grabbed a sword off a fallen guard and went searching for my siblings. After I had looked everywhere within the temple I remembered the place I had followed my brother to years ago. I made my way out of the temple grounds and into the city, where things were just as bad as inside. Using all I had learned I made it with only a few scratches and found the door locked. “Brother! Kari! Are you in there?!” I yelled as I pounded on the door with my fist. There was no reply but I could hear sounds coming from within.  Throwing my shoulder into the door a few times, I managed to burst into the room, where I happened upon a horrific scene. The room was aglow in unnatural lights, with sigils and runes painted everywhere in what seemed to be blood. Mathias was standing there with his back toward me over an alter that was not there the last time I had been here. Staring for a moment I suddenly was able to recognize that upon the alter laid Kariana, motionless, but a horrified look on her face. “Ah, took you long enough, dear sister. I’m sorry to say you’re too late, you’ve missed all the fun!” Mathias said as he slowly turned to me. He was completely covered in blood and in his hand he grasped a still beating heart. “I was hoping you would be first, but it seems the fates chose our dear sister instead.” He said with a large unnatural smile creeping along his face. I stood there, speechless, tears starting to well in my eyes and I started to stumble towards him. Before I could get close, the heart, still beating started to be surrounded by a purple miasma then burst into a hellish flame. “Ah, don’t worry.” he said in a cheerful voice. “Our dear sister wants to greet you as well!”  With that her body convulsed violently for a moment, then sat up, turned on the table and stood there. Her face still frozen in horror and her chest cavity was exposed as if something had burst forth from it. “WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS MATHIAS?!” I screamed at him while tears were falling from my eyes like waterfalls. “WHAT DROVE YOU TO THIS MADNESS?!”  “Madness? No. THIS IS NOT MADNESS! I WILL SHOW YOU, OUR PARENTS, EVERYONE WHAT TRUE MADNESS IS!” He replied screaming back at me.  With that my sisters body ran towards me, distorting it’s features, her legs elongated and twisted, spines started protruding along her back and arms. As she swung at me, her fingers grew into long claws and her eyes went black. Before I could react she sent me flying backwards into the wall hard enough to crack the stone.  “You see sister, don’t you think she’s more useful like this? You will turn out even better! Mother and Father won’t be able to ignore me any more!” he exclaimed walking over to me.  Time seemed to stop. For a moment I laid there in silence in a pool of my own blood. The pain wasn’t present, and there was no sound for what seemed forever. Then out of nowhere a voice, “I task you with cleansing this blight your blood has wrought upon the world. End those that would corrupt the world and the natural order and be a protector of life.” As the voice faded my body felt as if I was being embraced, it was warm and my body seemed to knit itself back together. Then time flowed again, my brother stood over me with my sister, who aside from her face with the same frozen look, was unrecognizable.  I stood up, grabbing my sword, and turned to face him. “Oh you still have some fight left in you? He sneered. “We’ll have to fix that then, dear sister, if you’d please?” And Kariana’s body lunged forward again. Before I knew I reacted, my blade bathed in a radiant glow and in one swift motion removed her head, ending the flourish with me standing in front of my brother and the sword through his chest.  With a shocked look on his face he spat up blood on to me. “Heh… Well I’ll be seeing you shortly… Dear… Sister…” Where his last words as we both collapsed to our knees. I stayed there sobbing, for what seemed like ages, until I passed out.  When I awoke I was in my mothers bed, an acolyte was sitting by the door reading a book. She took notice of my stirring and ran out of the room yelling for my mother. Moments later my parents, along with a few others from the clergy walked into the room. I sat up, but before I could say anything my mother rushed over and wrapped her arms around me. “Where is Kariana? Where is Mathias? Please tell me I was only having a nightmare...” I uttered in a raspy voice. With that she squeezed me harder and I could hear a couple of the priestess’ crying. “They… are gone. We thought we had lost you as well… You’ve been asleep for over a week now and even my gifts could not wake you.” Mother said  as she pulled back to look at me.   “I… Something, someone spoke to me… I think it was Bahamut… They felt warm… Like this… Oh! What about the undead that was attacking?!” I asked, concerned. Father walked up, handed me a cup of water and said “They were dealt with. There were plenty of injuries but...” Mother interrupted him with “There will time for that later, for now let her get her strength back.”  After that I had explained everything to them that I had witnessed, going back to me following him years ago. They did not doubt what I told them about hearing a voice. They also explained to me that after the fighting had ended they could not find us so they used a spell to lead them to us. Staying silent on what they saw, they told me that going through things in the room it was uncovered that the undead were Mathias’s doing but he was being taught, coerced by another. As they spoke, my eyes uncontrollably started to well up once more. They decided that was enough for now and had me rest some more.  Time passed, and I felt as if my task the voice had given me was not over yet. I started training in the ways of the paladins, there are several oaths one can take but there was one that stood out to me. An obscure oath that not many followed because of how it seemed to be of a more sinister nature. However it fit perfectly with what the voice had asked me to do. This was the Oath of Death. Many see it as something to fear, however death is only natural, and those that would disrupt the order should be ended. Though not entirely happy with my decision, my parents did not try to stop me.  I never let the events escape my mind, but instead of letting them chain me down, I used them to fuel my actions. In my brothers notebooks he would detail his encounters with his benefactor, a man who used the name Carthapilus. The notes told of long rants the man would go on about society and how people who did not use their life to the fullest did not deserve it. Though unsure of how accurate the accounts and descriptions of the man were, I had memorized them and kept the books on my person at all time, in search of this man.  More years passed, with my training completed I went traveling with a group of adventurers. We had our ups and downs but we became good friends, helping people, exploring dungeons, etc. Along the way I gathered more clues on the man I hunted. I also grew close to one of the men traveling with me by the name of Timon Court. He was a roguish sort, devilishly handsome, yet withdrawn from most interaction with other people. We shared our pasts and eventually decided to share out future. Getting married in my home city, with my mother being the one to head the procession. We wanted a small ceremony but with who my family was and the good our group had done there were countless people there. Afterwards we continued with our companions on our journeys, though a few months later we learned I was pregnant and decided for the time being we would take a break.  My daughter was born to us when I was twenty one and we named her Aislin Kari Hearthburn. Three years had passed before my restlessness couldn’t be quelled any longer and I set back out. Timon stayed at our home, he felt his days adventuring were over.  In my travels we discovered the man I was looking for was a disgraced baron lording over a secluded city in the mountains. Hordes of undead patrolled the streets but they weren't attacking the people, who looked disheveled and worn down. Not daring to take on the hordes with only the handful of us we stealthily entered and talking to people found there was an underground resistance. We devised a plan for an all out attack, they would deal with the undead while we entered the manor and dealt with Cathaphilus. The battle wasn’t that long, the undead he commanded were many, but weak. He himself was no fighter, when he was beaten and bleeding out, I told him who I was, his only reply was a guttural blood filled laughter. I had finally finished what I set out to do so long ago but I didn’t know if I should have felt relieved or frustrated.  I returned to my home and family with the news, deciding that my life on the road with finished. I visited the graves of my siblings often, told my daughter stories about the good memories I had with them and about my travels as she grew. I took up new responsibilities in the monastery such as teaching new acolytes and acting as a midwife to those in the city.  One night while taking my bath, there was a noise behind me. I figured it was Timon coming to join me. The figure knelt down behind me, wrapped one arm around my neck and plunged a blade into the underside of my skull.  I then woke up on an alter, with 3 others in a cold, desolate world."}]}

Muspell is a gnome wizard."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Muspell Heavyhand is a deep gnome wizard specializing in illusion magic but also partial to evocation and abjuration spells. He is hunchbacked and burn-covered, and the left side of his face is paralyzed in a grimace. Lacking eyebrows and his head a web of scar tissue, Muspell prefers to shave off what little black hair still grows there. His slate-grey eyes are rarely visible because of the dark-lensed goggles he keeps on unless he is underground. To avoid stares in very populated areas, Muspell usually hides behind his illusion magic. He is gruff in all senses of the word but also sagacious. He is paranoid, neurotic, and has a short, violent temper, but is ultimately good-hearted and fiercely loyal to those who have won his trust. He speaks little of the Underdark, so full of shame and trauma is the memory of his time there. He despises drow. Muspell was born during the Festival of the Star in the gnome city of Hypogaia Though birth at such a time is usually considered an auspicious omen, Muspell’s life has been anything but lucky. Nearly strangled by his own umbilical cord, it was only through the intervention of a skilled midwife that he survived his first day. He was the only child of his family, and unusually happy and curious. He was always poking around the forbidden corners around his family’s property, a sly grin on his angular face. Muspell idolized his father Surtr, a mighty breachgnome who answered directly to the king. Shortly after his family was moved to the outskirts of the territory for a long term assignment, they were attacked by a band of drow. Muspell’s father was on patrol when the drow came; Muspell hid successfully but had perfect view of the drow as they viciously raped and butchered his mother. When Surtr returned, he vowed vengeance upon the dark elves and departed with his son in tow. Muspell spent his adolescent years deep in the drow tunnels following his father in his quest for revenge. Father and son spoke but minimally, numb to all feeling but rage. Surtr, a gnome possessed, provided but the barest essentials for his son’s survival as he cut his way through the drow ranks. Eventually making their way to the temple of the drow priestess that ordered the raid, Muspell and his father stumbled into a chamber with a surprise - a chained red dragon. The dragon attacked instinctively with its flame breath. When Muspell came to, his body seethed with pain of a full body burn.     As a slave of the drow priestess he’d come to kill, he often wished he’d succumbed to his injuries that day. Muspell was beaten daily and nearly driven mad by starvation, surviving only on carrion rats and mold scraped from corners of his cell. The priestess loved to tease him about his dead father as she forced him to do humiliating acts for her entertainment, ranging from the sadistic to the sexual. He managed to escape his cell one night while the priestess did battle with a rival in the nave of her temple. While sneaking out, Muspell stole a book from under an altar, hoping its pages might provide some nourishment for his aching belly. Somehow making his way outside of the city, he opened the book. The eldritch tome contained profane secrets unfit for a sane mind, and would have killed him outright with its energies if he were not already half insane. The experience left the poor young gnome in a coma.   Muspell would not awaken until nearly a year later, back in the city of his birth. Though the book was nowhere to be found, its evil had infected his psyche, the images within burned into his brain. He was physically rehabilitated and adopted by a family friend, the illusion mage Segojan Seamseeker. Unfortunately, Muspell’s mind had been warped by his traumatic childhood in such a way that he exhibited antisocial behavior frequently, eventually driving him to close himself off from even his would-be guardian. Forswearing all kinship, he threw himself into physical training, hoping to join the king’s forces to avenge his parents. He was rejected, however; years of abuse and malnourishment during his younger years had left him stunted and weak. Broken, Muspell attempted suicide by hanging himself. He awoke with Segojan standing over him. “Your sword arm may not be strong, but you possess a strength far rarer.” Segojan pointed to his head. “That of the mind. Study under me and channel your pain into a power which will aid you in your goal.” Muspell saw no other path. He was simply not strong to be a miner or gemcutter, he thought. He accepted. He started his studies late, but by adulthood he’d overtook his apprentice peers in magical proficiency. He simply had the knack. The confidence that accompanied this proficiency produced an emotion quite alien in him: confidence.  Muspell began, cautiously, to try his hand at courtship. The object of his affections was Frigga Seamseeker Though Segojan carried many reservations about a relationship between Muspell and his daughter, he withheld them with the hope that Muspell and his daughter, who was herself troubled by mental illness, might find mutual comfort. Frigga was apprehensive at first. Muspell was kyphotic and scarred from head to toe, marked by dragonfire and drow’s whip. His demeanor was vulgar and uncultured. Yet, within him she saw the boy that once explored caves fearless and with a permanent smile, the boy whose only joy was nuzzling his mother’s neck. They married in the Temple of the Earthcaller, and for the first time in his life, Muspell wept with joy. All seemed to be well, but for one thing. Months went by and Muspell failed to consummate the union. He was simply... impotent. Muspell came to realize to his great shame that he was only sexually attracted to drow. Frigga tried to be understanding but grew impatient. She wished for children. The indignance turned into arguments and the arguments turned into yelling matches.  Eventually, Frigga struck Muspell with a particularly strong verbal volley. Surtr was not dead, she claimed. He had been imprisoned as a traitor for abandoning his post and lay crippled in the burrow’s dungeons. She called him an idiot for his ignorance. Muspell screamed with the rage of his father and beat Frigga to unconsciousness with a stone pot. He flew to the dungeons, where he found Surtr, missing an arm and leg and pockmarked with burn scars. Muspell dared not interrupt his father’s labored snores, and forthwith journeyed to the prime material plane, cursing his land and its people and swearing never to return. "}]}

Include the following information."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alistair remembers nothing before his arrival in the cursed city of Yharnam. A young chondathan man in a city of xenophobes, he was given shelter by the Healing Church, a local institution which specialized in transfusions of extraordinary blood. His appellation came from the poor clothing in which he was found, and stuck. Yharnam is a curious city; shrouded in eternal darkness, the moon stands still, always staring from behind the gothic steeples that make up its skyline. Blood has a special place in Yharnam - transfusions are commonplace and a bigger source of intoxication than alcohol. In exchange for labor in the church’s weird gardens, Alistair was given food enough to live and blood enough to survive that life. None but the occasional nun spoke to him, and the church’s order of beast hunters ignored his very existence. The church was secretive enough never to allow him into its upper levels, but he sensed something mystical was at work behind its closed doors. A citywide plague known as Ashen Blood struck, leaving even the church crippled. As the city scrambled to find a cure, a now grown Alistair ventured into the forbidden areas through a broken window. There he found something quite surprising: an orphaned Great One, an infant eldritch power. The very sight of the being was shock enough that his hair fell from his scalp. He stared, perhaps for moments, perhaps for eons into the star-like eyes within the creature’s gaping, tentacled maw. He saw his life laid before him, every instant foreordained. Knowing how his life would end, he began to laugh, for it was suddenly hilarious to him. Life was a joke. He blinked and the vision ended. Like a dream, it faded from his mind too quickly to remember, all but one detail. He would serve Ebrietas’s inscrutable will; he would be her tool until such time as he earned his freedom... and transformation: the body of a spider and a brain lined with eyes. With an inhuman sucking sound and a flap of her her glowing, sinuous wings, Ebrietas, Daughter of the Cosmos bade him leave Yharnam to gather the weaponry necessary for her escape. For indeed, Ebrietas was not truly a prisoner of the church, she confided to his barely comprehending mind, but to another Great Old One. All Yharnam was. Caught in a dream ever-repeating yet never quite the same, dawn would only come to Yharnam if this yet unknown god could be slain, and only then could she be free. Forever changed by this encounter, Alistair started on his way. He was, however and perhaps for the first time, truly happy. No more tending the Lumenflower Garden. No more half-rotted bread and peasant blood. Only his own will and that of Ebrietas! Walking through the grey mists beyond the city, time again escaped him. His pilgrimage took years, though how many, none could say. Neither hunger nor thirst found him until he saw the sun on the horizon. He’d finally made it to Altain. To make ends meet while searching for leads for his quest, he took to swindling and murder. A favored tactic of his is to share the location of a “treasure” only to trap and rob those who would steal it. He loves to lie and will nearly always choose a lie over truth if it makes things more interesting. He is a bit clumsy and very much a coward, usually running from a fight he cannot win. He sees most people as pawns in the great game the Old Ones play. Alistair’s treachery knows some exceptions. He is, once one gets beyond his facade, a true and loyal friend. When swept up in the moment, he is even capable of true heroism and bravery though he’s usually quick to dismiss such behavior as a foolish lapse in judgment."}]}

One of the stranger travelers to visit the city, Gigmucc sells insects and spell components, and at extremely reasonable prices. He has spent the last few months vending his wares all about town, but found one of his products especially popular in the red light district, so is often there.     Gigmucc’s story is, unsurprisingly, a strange one. Growing up a blue grung in an extremely rigid, color-based caste system did not leave very much room for an advancement in his fortunes. Not quite at the bottom of this hierarchy, he was nonetheless treated like dirt. He was never popular with the females and his only skill seemed to be his talent for building traps. He yearned for a life outside the swamp, where he would not be forced to work long hours for a few insects.     One day, fate struck when the village’s eggs were stolen by a tribe of lizardmen. Short on warriors from a recent battle, Gigmucc was drafted into an expeditionary force to retrieve them. Upon defeating the lizardmen, Gigmucc’s squad discovered an interesting piece of property the lizardfolk had: human slaves. The grung also had human slaves, of course, but theirs were raised from birth by the grung, only spoke Grung, and were kept in a state of hypnotic semi-consciousness by regularly applied grung venom. The lizardfolks’ slaves were different. Captured by the lizardfolk, they spoke a language he’d never heard before.   Taking one of these slaves as his own, he made the man teach him the human tongue. The man then told stories of greater Tennarra, stories that eventually convinced Gigmucc to free the slave and venture out on his own. Gigmucc discovered a knack for salesmanship and taste for human decadence. “What a limited life,” he thought back on his village, “what a poor and pathetic way to live. Being a second class citizen in human society still beats the very best the grung village can offer!”"}]}

One of the stranger travelers to visit the city, Gigmucc sells insects and spell components, and at extremely reasonable prices. He has spent the last few months vending his wares all about town, but found one of his products especially popular in the red light district, so is often there.     Gigmucc’s story is, unsurprisingly, a strange one. Growing up a blue grung in an extremely rigid, color-based caste system did not leave very much room for an advancement in his fortunes. Not quite at the bottom of this hierarchy, he was nonetheless treated like dirt. He was never popular with the females and his only skill seemed to be his talent for building traps. He yearned for a life outside the swamp, where he would not be forced to work long hours for a few insects.     One day, fate struck when the village’s eggs were stolen by a tribe of lizardmen. Short on warriors from a recent battle, Gigmucc was drafted into an expeditionary force to retrieve them. Upon defeating the lizardmen, Gigmucc’s squad discovered an interesting piece of property the lizardfolk had: human slaves. The grung also had human slaves, of course, but theirs were raised from birth by the grung, only spoke Grung, and were kept in a state of hypnotic semi-consciousness by regularly applied grung venom. The lizardfolks’ slaves were different. Captured by the lizardfolk, they spoke a language he’d never heard before.   Taking one of these slaves as his own, he made the man teach him the human tongue. The man then told stories of greater Tennarra, stories that eventually convinced Gigmucc to free the slave and venture out on his own. Gigmucc discovered a knack for salesmanship and taste for human decadence. “What a limited life,” he thought back on his village, “what a poor and pathetic way to live. Being a second class citizen in human society still beats the very best the grung village can offer!”"}]}

Marian’s mother, Celine, worked in the kitchens of House Witwood and his father, Feldran, was a local tailor. As a child Marian lived an easy enough life, with the Witwoods providing an education well above that someone of his status would normally receive, while his parents taught him their trades.   Marian also loved the theatre, and every month when The Wandering Whale troupe came into town he would buy tickets, watch joyously, and badger the actors for the rest of the day. He was almost obsessive, and spent all his spare money buying new scripts, novels, and books about the wonders of the world.  Leaving Home  At around the age of 15 Marian began to feel discontented with his life. While his life in Emon was pleasant, Marian found the familiarity of the city increasingly dull. The tales he had heard of the world beyond thrilled him, but the refuge of fiction started to feel too shallow. Around the same time the Witwoods’ generosity was growing ever more limited, as many in the house began to see the now-teenage boy as a freeloader, not family.  And so when The Wandering Whale came into town next Marian hopped on board, trading his services as a tailor for a small bed onboard their caravan. For the next few years Marian and Ruvin travelled with the troupe. Over time Marian began to take on greater roles in the shows, quickly becoming a regular feature of the troupe’s shows. It was a good time in his life, even with the chaos in the wider world, but once again Marian started to feel like there should be something more to his life. And so, caught up in dreams of greatness, he made a terrible mistake.  The Feywild  It began, as so many dreadful things do, with wondrous dreams. Marian dreamt of a land of dream, where he was no longer bound with the ties of possibility. A place of colour and emotion that set his mind aflame with inspiration. Since then he has never been sure if she brought the dreams or if the dreams attracted her, he had always quietly hoped the latter.  She called herself Amhuir Glamhain, later Marian learned that was actually a Sylvan title: The Lady of Glory. It took some time for him to realise that she was more than simply another dream, but slowly she grew more vital, more assertive, until eventually he could not deny her reality. She made him an offer: come out to the woods at midnight and she would grant him the inspiration he so desired. Marian went, of course, and she delivered on her promise dutifully.  Marian remembers little of his time in her domain clearly. Perhaps he engaged in actions of enormity, perhaps he was comatose in a field somewhere. Lucid moments were few and far between, and Marian could count on one hand the number of days he is confident are completely real. Some days it was the vilest tortures, some days halcyon dreams, others grand quests. Dim memories tell of whole lifetimes he experienced, now only a vague recollection, or maybe all he ever had was that vague recollection, left to mock him with what he could never know.   Returning  But eventually, after what felt like both a moment and a millennium, it was over. Marian awoke on a cold hillside, jutting up from a fetid swamp. He was weak, exhausted, and still far from convinced that it was real. So he did nothing. For the rest of the night he just lay there, waiting for whatever vision this was to end, passing in and out of fevered consciousness. When he was found he was barely alive, laying in the grey light of dawn.   He was taken in by a woman by the name of Eliza Vance, an elderly fisherwoman who had found him on a walk through the swamps. It took Marian a week to even remember his name from the tangle of lives he’d lived. For months Eliza housed and fed Marian as he recovered, both physically and mentally. It was during these months that he wrote his first full play: Fractures.  The Grand Performance  With the play completed then came the true difficulty, which was managing to organise a performance as a penniless nobody - particularly one who’d been missing for several years. At first Marian did the obvious, and went around to the theatre troupes of the city, trying to find anyone willing to put on the performance, but without any money to offer such an experimental play was considered too risky.   So Marian had to take matters into his own hands. To add to his challenges, soon enough his poverty wasn’t the only obstacle - a high-ranking local cleric of The Lawbearer, Talia Rayne, had heard tell of Marian’s play and become determined that it should not be performed. While exploring some more illicit means of funding for his play, Marian met Mijira Norixius, a woman of remarkable cunning.  Together the pair worked for three months, raising money, putting together a troupe, and evading Talia’s efforts to shut them down. It was probably the busiest time of Marian’s life, juggling (not always strictly legal) funding exercises, dodging the increasing roster of people less than pleased with him, and rehearsing for the play itself. Eventually however, it was done.   The first performance of Fractures was not exactly met with riotous popularity. It was received well enough, but it was rather too bizarre to be exactly an instant hit. In short time however, it did becomes something of a cultural fad amongst the wealthy, word having been spread by some visiting merchants who had seen the first performance. And so Marian Cullyster was, however briefly, catapulted to a state of near-celebrity.   The Current Time  Whatever fame he had soon faded, and after a highly profitable initial tour of Fractures his stardom faded to more a topic of trivia than conversation. It was, however, enough to set him up to continue to travel the country, writing and performing plays in towns and cities across the land. For the next few years his life saw little variation, continuing the same life of a roaming thespian, until his most recent show at last brought him back to Stilben. This, he thought, was a great chance to meet back up with his old friends Ruvin and Mijira, and if they could be roped into performing, well all the better. "}]}

Morag always told her how like her mother she looked with her red hair and green eyes. All she knew of her father was that he was an elf, and her inheritance from her father meant that Briar was always very easily identified as a half-elf. Morag never let her feel awkward or as if she didn’t quite fit in, and Briar grew up learning to ignore and laugh off any attempts at shaming her heritage.  Briar’s earliest memories are of Morag – Morag cooking, Morag preparing tinctures and ointments, Morag teaching Briar about the world around them and which parts of plants and animals can be harvested to create healing agents. Morag nurtured Briar’s love of cooking and herbalism, hoping to set her on a path of independence and self-sufficiency.  When Briar was 5, she found the fiddle secreted away under Morag’s bed. Morag found her plucking the strings, enraptured by the sounds that she was producing with the instrument. From that point onward, Briar was rarely far from the fiddle, teaching herself what she could, seeking out musicians when they visited the town to learn what she could.  At the age of 11, Briar met Thia, another half-elf who was in the service of the local blacksmith. Almost without realising it or knowing how it happened, Thia became another member of Morag and Briar’s family. Despite their many differences, Thia and Briar balanced each other out in ways they didn’t always recognise.  As Morag grew older and began to slow down, Briar went to work in the local tavern as a waitress. She would pester the tavern owner to let her show off her cooking skills in the kitchen regularly, but her real dream was to get on the small stage to play the fiddle and sing for the crowd. Most of the town had heard her playing and singing at one time or another, but being on the stage was something different. It was almost a need for Briar.  And then…everything changed. In one night, Thia made a decision that meant she had to flee the town, and Morag succumbed to her illness. With nothing left for her there, Briar gathered what was most important to her – Morag’s iron skillet and her fiddle – and fled the town with Thia to start a new life."}]}

Using dark magic, they convinced him that an evil beast , a Harpy, had come into his homestead, looking to murder his family. They gave him a dark blade (which the twisted cultists had stolen from an altar to Shar) and watched as their devious plan unfolded. The harpy rose up to attack Eltar but not quick enough, he thrust the blade into the monster's chest ... but as his blade sank into it's flesh, the harpy's shriek turned into his baby sister's (tweak) dying moans.The image shattered as he broke free of the dark illusion but it was too late. He could hear the chanting of the cultists now - Bhaal! Bhaal! Bhaal... then silence fell as they realised that something unexpected was happening. A dark rift, a knife wound in the fabric of the material plane, appeared behind his sister ... mist-like shadows began pulling her silently into the rift. He stood immobile - heart hammering in his ears. A satisfied, death-like sigh drifted from the rift and then she was gone. A second passed before a dark, shadow-like humanoid crept from the rift and crawled towards Eltar - a jagged grin appearing on its face. It came to eye level with Eltar, staring him in the eye before drifting onto the blade, allowing Eltar to stab its chest - and as he did, the creature began to flow into the sword until it was no more. Eltar looked ahead, the darkness drifting from his eyes, upon the lifeless form of his sister. The rift no longer behind her - only the cool evening air and deafening silence.    A few days later at his sister's funeral, his mother presented him with a travel pack, warning him that the Clan believe him mad, guilty of purposefully killing his sister. They had found no cultists and intended to have him brought to justice. With his final words to her, he told her that he would grant justice to the true murderer's of his sister, and to all who would incriminate the innocent - no mercy, no cruelty, only justice.  He had found it impossible to rid himself of the sword, it had become addictive to him, something of alluring power that he knew he could use in his mission.

My parents wouldn’t speak much about where they came from and any time that I asked they shied away from the question and told me that their village didn’t exist anymore. From the time I was young I was always fascinated with any book I could put my hands on. I knew that we didn’t have money for me to go to a mages school, so I went into the “family business” and by that I mean I worked at one of the counting houses until I helped my bosses out of a legal dispute over a silly matter involving some elves and a currency that they claimed didn’t exist anymore. I had been reading the accounting tomes for fun and realized I could help out the company. The company was called “Small Change” a counting house ran mostly by dwarves and gnomes. We weren’t well known, but boy were we reliable.   My boss Torven decided that since I helped them out of that jam, they would pay for me to become the legal advocate for the company, I was moving up in the world. As I was learning the ropes at the legal college I met the love of my life. Gorgeous gnome and heck of a gal, Eilissa. In one of the first meetings of our cohort I could not take my eyes off of her. Those swirling blue globes sparkling in any light. After a few years of learning we graduated and soon after I took her as my wife. Her parents were already gone at that time, but my family at the counting house paid for our modest ceremony.   Life was good. I was working as a representative for “Small Change” and working towards buying a small house on the edge of the city for us. We were happy and nothing in the world could bring us down. For 20 years we thrived as a couple and finally we were hoping to soon have children. During this time I became a teacher at the school that we both went to years ago. I was one of the best and brightest due to my voracious appetite for books of any and every kind. I started really making good money and Eilissa was so proud.   Early in the year 1490 Eilissa started having a deep cough that sounded quite unnatural. We thought it was just some easy malady, something easy to be fixed. We went to the apothecary to find a remedy, and the potions stopped the coughing for a while. Soon the coughing came back and there was nothing the local apothecary could do to help my dear wife. (She had a very high resistance to magical potions and healing you see.) She started coughing up blood in the summer of 1491 around Kythorn. So late in 1491 after trying any remedy available to us, I started roaming the world with my wife. I quit my job and decided that I needed to care for my wife. I took her all over the sword coast, to witches, shamans, wizards, clerics, but none could break this sickness. Finally in early 1492 I was out of money and out of options.  My wife’s condition was worsening and there was nothing I could do. I went back to work part time and started saving up for a possible resurrection spell, something I did not want to think about, but something that was very possibly necessary in the future.   My wife died on the morning of the Autumn Equinox on the 21st of Eleint. I was in mourning for a week. I could not bear to leave my bed save to relieve myself and to drink. I heard a rumor that resurrection spells were not working and there were problems with bringing people back from the dead. There was a wizard that claimed that he could still perform the spell, but I would have to pay up front. To pay for the procedure I had to use the last of my savings and sell our beautiful little home, but I would do anything to bring my dear Eilissa back to me.  I have nothing. My wife is dead and I was conned out of all of my earthly possessions save a few gold, my pack of books, and my pack. I decided that I was going to learn the arcane, I was going to bring my wife back if it kills me. I keep a locket of her hair in a glass bauble around my neck on a thin golden chain. I will fix this and I will bring resurrection back. I started researching this curse and all research leads to Chult. There was an adventuring group going to Chult seemingly to find the source of this curse maybe I can find them and join them in their journey. "}]}

The son of the popular strongman performer in the caravan, Rollo shares his father's girth, but decidedly not his attitude -- he's been an inveterate slacker since the age of six. On top of his near-total lack of ambition, Rollo is oftentimes vacant and kind of flaky, which is reflected in his religion: he worships Ao, a God who has never been seen or heard from, and who has never interacted with anything in the universe (to anyone's knowledge). Since there is practically no canonical text to worship Ao by, Rollo has used his faith to spin together various improvised bits of New Age-ish philosophy, all of which seem only superficially profound. If he had to be pinned down on a goal in life, he would volunteer it's \"going with the flow\" or \"being in and around\".  Despite this (or perhaps because of it), he is an extremely friendly, helpful, and outgoing dragonborn, and thus the members of the caravan in general think well of him. Well to a certain point, perhaps, but well. And not too many members of the caravan say much about his odd faith because it *does* seem to work, after all -- Rollo has shown himself to be unusually talented at healing other people's ills. Never mind that he claims it's because he's been \"touched by life\".  Rollo is a strict vegetarian, and his favorite foods are blueberries and mushrooms. (More the latter than the former.) He also has a great fondness for unusual and exotic incenses, and deliberately goes out of his way to sample some whenever possible.  When pressed into combat, he is unexpectedly effective, since strength comes naturally to him, but he maintains his off-kilter view of the world even in battle: he wields two maces, one with a giant peace symbol painted on its head, and the other mace's head is painted with a giant yellow symbol of a smiling face. He has yet to name his two maces, although he says that they will reveal their names to him when the time is right. "}]}

It was through this connection that Varis learned to appreciate the knowledge that his father had access to, but yet he never fully committed to. At a young age, around his 40th year, his father was handling some blighted scrolls recovered from the catacombs of Shahabel, a fallen elven stronghold. His father soon fell ill, hallucinating with visions of his dead wife, and died after a painful week of festering sores. Seeing this drove Varis into a dark depression, unusually deep for most elves even after a loss so dear. He became consumed by the loss and sought answers to his father's death in the library's tomes. Four years after starting his search Varis found the answer to his father's death in an unremarkable book, titled The Curious Fungus of Iylelea. It had taken time, but never again would he let someone he loved die from a careless lack of knowledge. The answers to everything were in the parchments, and he would make sure to read everything he could. Following in his father's footsteps he became an under-scribe in the regional library of Aratheas. His fervor for knowledge helped him to comprehend books that elves double his aged had hardly heard of. By the time he was 75 he was promoted to scribe and then over-scribe by 100. Varis was destined to be a scholar, cloistered in dusty rooms over obscure, crusty scrolls his whole life, but events in his 103rd year would change his life forever. The orcs led by war chieftain Shulhug were rumored to be roaming outside there ancestral lands, but no one imagined that they could move so far, so quickly. Varis was in his study when the first screams in the city were heard. He grabbed as many scrolls and parchments as he could and loaded them into a wagon. He didn't stop to inquire about the other scribes, he only cared and was consumed with the preservation of knowledge. Knowledge would outlive them all anyway, just as it outlived his father. As Varis passed the ridge on the edge of Aratheas he looked back to see the city smoking, and the famed library, his home for over 50 years licked by flames. The screams faded into the distance as Varis drove further into the heart of elven territory. When he reached the next city it became clear he was the only survivor of Arathea. Well, him and his two dozen books. He looked at his cart, a measly scrap of what glories were now lost in the dust. He thought of his fellow scribes, abandoned by their friend and left to be flayed by the orcs. The shock of the situation had worn off and now he saw his actions in full day and was filled with the same sadness that he felt after his father's death. He sank to his knees and wept.  When Varis looked up he saw the unsleeping eye of Helm on sign above a door. He walked towards the chapel as in a trance. Inside was a cleric of Helm, who offered absolution to Varis in exchange for a lifetime of service--a deal accepted readily in the moment, though questioned many times since. Varis became a cleric of Helm that day. With his vast knowledge he rose through the ranks to become second in command of the regional Helm order. He now is zealous to become first in command, which can only happen if he has exploits to boast about. Exploits in which it is clear that Helm protected him and is with him. Varis has put his scholarly pursuits on hold for the last 20 years as he tries to fight for glory and honor, in the hopes of one day reigning supreme in his order."}]}

Fronan peered around the thick boar skin that served as a barrier between his room and the house’s central common area.  “Since the sight of his own blood rendered him weak as the people from which he came.” Rendar crossed his arms over a chest covered with grey hair. “I know you love the boy; I do as well, and you cannot gainsay me. Do not forget who it was that convinced the tribe to keep him.”  “Then why?” Varelen hissed in a harsh whisper. “Why send him away if you love him so much?” The Barbarian woman took a slow, deep breath to calm herself before continuing. “Rendar, I will forever be grateful to you. You convinced the Council to allow me to keep Fronan. You fought with me to allow him to train with the other children. But if you insist on this nonsense of sending him away, by Crom, I will show you just how strong a Barbarian maiden can be.”  Rendar sighed and inclined his head. “As you wish, but if he fails to bond, I am not sure I can keep the Council from doing forcibly what I am suggesting he do on his own. If Durnjak wins the High Seat, there is nothing I can do to keep Fronan safe.” The seasoned Barbarian warrior ducked under the tent flap and was gone.  Now, several months later, Fronan wished his mother had listened, wished he himself had stood up and made his own decision. But he had not, and both Rendar and his mother hunted with the ancestors, struck down by Durnjak when they fought the Council’s decision.  Fronan peaked into a belt pouch to check on Jonathan. He slept. Though weak and fragile, Fronan loved this strange creature, the only one he had ever been able to bond. Perhaps, somehow, with training, magic, or the luck of the gods, Jonathan would grow strong. The small ship creaked around him, and Fronan tried to sleep. This new group of companions could be just what he needed to help him fulfill the wishes of Rendar and his mother. Perhaps, with their support, he would defeat the man (not necessarily human) with three eyes, murderer of his first, halfling family, and overcome the weakness that had kept Fronan from protecting his second, human family.  Fronan laid his head back against his pillow, dreaming of a mighty Jonathan at his side and the look of fear on Durnjak’s ugly face as Fronan returned to crush his enemies, see them driven before him, and hear the lamentations of their women."}]}

Patches of her body here and there show leathery red skin where she's missing clusters of scales and from the flat top of her head a crop of small horns protrude haphazardly in different directions.  She picks up two little pots with 'drakeroot' and 'moon-pepper' scrawled on them in blue cave-ooze ink, sniffs one then the other, goes to place one back on the shelf, pauses... and then changes her mind again.  Just then, the voice of Cram, the Bonesnapper clan's chief comes screeching from outside the kitchen.  \"Kip!  Hurry the skeg up with the food, we need to go out scavenging!\" \"Sorry, sorry!\" Her ears flatten and she scurries over to a large, simmering pot and quickly but carefully measures out a pinch of moon-pepper which she sprinkles into the pot.  She holds her paws up to the warmth of the fire below, closes her eyes in concentration and traces a circle in the air with a claw.  After a moment the fire roars and the flames pick up, causing Kip to smile as the pot boils and bubbles enthusiastically.  Just then, Cram jerks his head through the kitchen door.  \"Come on you little scrotling!  I've told you about pratting around with the food!  Just BOIL THE SLUGS!\" Kip ducks behind the counter and peeks between a sack of dried crickets and a pile of tattered books.  She stammers \"y-yes chief, I'm sorry!\" Cram snarls and yanks his head back into the corridor, nearly knocking over a young boy as he storms off.  The bright-scaled kobold boy rolls his eyes at Clam then strolls cheerfully into the kitchen. Kip's ears twitch happily as she recognises her brother.  \"Hi Bunt, I've got something new for you to try, I hope it's ok\". Bunt's eyes light up and he licks his fangs. \"Smells great.  Don't worry about Cram, he's nervous because the big boss lady is making some kind of deal with a visitor right now\" Kip slops a steaming spoonful of the slug stew into a bowl and piles some sad-looking, wilted leaves on top.  \"A visitor?  I wonder if that's the person she's been getting letters from.  She normally gets me to read all her letters aloud to her and then dictates a reply for me to write back but for some reason she wouldn't let me near these ones.  I suppose that's ok though, dragons do like to have privacy.\" Bunt reaches for the bowl but stops as Kip sheepishly gestures for him to wait.  He scritches thoughtfully at one of his shiny black horns.  \"Well I wonder if she'll let this visitor leave without setting them on fire or eating them this time.\" Kip covers the top of the bowl with both paws and closes her eyes again.  When she removes her paws and wafts away the steam, the previously sloppy lumps floating in the stew are crisp and brown and the leaves are a luscious green, curled into small canoe shapes that float on the surface.  \"Ok it's ready.\" Suddenly, a voice booms from beneath the caverns.  Much, much deeper than Cram's... Less of a screech and more of a firm, confident rumble.  Nevertheless, Kip instinctively cowers behind the counter top again. \"KIP BONESNAPPER!!\" Bunt puts a gentle, well-kept set of claws on her back.  \"You better go, seems the boss lady wants you.  This looks delicious though, thanks Kip.\"  When Kip enters the chamber, the familiar but always majestic sight of Ysnoth greets her but this time the dragon's normally disinterested scowl is fixed intently on Kip, eyes narrowed.  Next to Ysnoth, dwarfed by her impressive size stands an unfamiliar figure.  A sharply-dressed dragonborn with a green-eyed doberman standing to attention at their side. Though the dragon's voice resonates deep within Kip's gut, Ysnoth speaks gently and deliberately like a cautious diplomat.  \"Kip, my faithful servant.  I have come to an agreement with this... person.  You and your brother are, as I'm sure you know... a little different to the rest of your clan and you will be leaving very shortly to be tutored by this person's associates to achieve your full potential.  I shall speak to your brother seperately.  For now, go and start gathering your belongings immediately.  And Kip... don't forget the books you 'rescued' from my discarded treasure\"."}]}

Erastil??  Erastil holy symbol  What? Why?  HOW???  Ooh, well, it would start - I believe - with the tales I'm not supposed to have heard about my mother, and I have been hearing them from a somewhat young age, thanks to my nanny, Pefantica... how she loved to gossip!  I'm told - and told by those who should know - that I take after my mother to a quite alarming degree, and that the fervent hope of my extended family is that in a few centuries I'll settle down and study the tomes of arcane & divine lore and become a mystic theurge just as my parents have.  Until then, though, I'm still a youth - though not by any accounting a maiden! - I'm unattached, unbound, unpromised and now I am out experiencing the world, though experiencing it a lot more first hand than my father or brother would ever had permitted, had they known of my plans!  I have mother to thank for the fact that they don't... I still can't believe that she hid my pregnancy so well, she's truly amazing. And... now I think about it... I am aware of a few year long absences of my mother that I know about, and ... there are many more, now that I have made some discreet enquiries.  Gosh. My mind is quite boggled. . .  Wow, mother dearest... that's a lot of ploughing that has happened in your field! How many half siblings am I likely to meet on my travels and travails? I think I am sure of at least four... and maybe several more!  Nevertheless, with her example to lead me, I'm far more certain, now, that I'm on the right path!  And that path is helping those of less fortunate birth than I, which is why I'm a paladin of Elastril.  Living in Brevoy for several decades convinced me of the true nature of my desires to serve the greater good by living as an example of what should be, rather than what is. What should be is freedom to live a natural and wholesome life that doesn't ask for more than you can give, and where you don't take more than you need. Less procedural, more pragmatic. Tolerant and accepting of change, rather than rigid and unalterable.  You share as needed, charity is rewarded and encouraged. Mutual obligations, rights and respect are what bind a society together.  That's why I eloped with the human merchants and, kind of, how I became pregnant with Erianis half a century or so ago. My they were good carefree times... Oh that party... it only lasted a week but gave me a lovely child who will last, well, her lifetime if not mine...  if only I knew which one of the merchants was her father... oh well, it's not really that important, what matters is that she's here now, enjoying life thanks to their and my momentary though many moments of passion! Besides, they're all long dead by now, poor short lived humans.  Pregnancy. It's quite a sensitive subject amongst elven society, a half elf child - any pregnancy is a sensitive topic, really - not that children out of wedlock - or species - are illegal or even immoral, just frowned upon ny elves of my families acquaintance. So Eriana is an unacknowledged child of mine, as to not bring shame upon the noble elven name of n'denGina... long may they flourish. It's likely the God's wish that elven women are far more fruitful with non-elves than elves, who knows? As yet, not I. Hmm, I might make some enquiries about that. Or... not.  Where was I? Oh yes, I'm a paladin, lawful as well as good. And a paladin of a God recognised as human. And... I'm elven, not human! And a woman, presumed maidenly. It's... it's like the shorter lived races don't even begin to realise that an elf feels everything they do, but for centuries, not mere decades.  Erastil taught me pragmatism, not poetry. Accomplishments not artistry.  And survival not sophistry...  He taught me things that matter here and now, to enable survival in the here and now. No elegant semantics about Natures balance, the wheel of time, eugenics, and the guidance planning of the 'lesser' races. Just simple, basic and common sense guidance and knowledge about how to survive, how to build and how to prosper.  That's what I want.  Prosperity.  Prosperity for that which I consider under my guidance.  I shall bring these lands under my, our, loose guidance to bring to them the prosperity that they can offer. I'll guide the farmers to farm the fertile lands, the woodsmen to crop the forests, and give the townsfolk the wisdom to plan ahead, to store water and food gathered in the good times and to keep some in reserve for when times - inevitably until paradise arrives - get tough.  I'll help make laws to bring profit, honour and respect to the travelers who trade goods between outposts, to the farmers and artisans who create those goods, and to the merchants who gather, collect and organise the transfer of commodities between each layer of the nation, slowly binding the land into a bond of mutual and bountiful trade that brings benefits to all who live in the Duchy of Novus Kyonin!  By my honour:  Imogene nden'Gina, known to some as Imogene Bright Water  Paladin of Erastil.  Duchess of Novus Kynonin.   -=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-  Imogene Brightwater's family: Illegitimate child: Erianis Heartgazer, half elf, female, 55 years old, whose Human father died 50 years ago, father is unknown to child and even I don't know his name or lineage (it was a GREAT party and a really awesome week, though, wow....!) Imogene's father, Inneash Darkspear, doesn't know of this child (or the long dead human father/s) nor does my brother, Tanae Bloodseeker. Tanae's a bit... odd, and more than a little forthright, but means well. Couldn't even be chosen by a non-derivative nickname though, and that's public, which is more shameful than my hidden halfbreed child, according to most etiquette I know! My mother, Ralaehen Sunseeker, knows of Erainis, since she helped hide my pregnancy, birth and 15 years of raising my daughter. I don't keep in regular contact with my daughter, but we do try to catch up every few years, liaising through my mother. Erianis "}]}

He and his father were ostracized from other Aarakocra and lived alone on the outskirts of their rural village. Aki's father suffered from visions of threatening spirits, and often fell into fits of hallucination and fearful screams in public. However, his father wasn't the only threat to the peace. An evil organization of monks, the Monks of the Long Death, made their home not far from the sanctity of Akacheta's village. Seeing Aki cast out from the population made him their next project. The monks' leader, a nameless, ancient Kenku man, approached young Aki during one of the many instances he was entirely alone. The old man put a mangled wing around the small bird's shoulders and croaked a string of horrible words into his ear. From that moment on, Aki was never the same. He became even more finicky than before. He was paranoid that he was being watched. But he wasn't able to remember the Kenku man or what he said, or even what he was really afraid of. The rest of the Aarakocra just saw it as Aki following in his old man's footsteps. Eventually, Aki's father's condition deteriorated, and on his deathbed he made Akacheta promise to never become like him and to never be so afraid that he cannot live. At the time of his father's death, Aki was nearing adulthood. It was at this time that the Kenku monk decided it would be best to take Aki under his wing, so to speak. When approached, Ali was neither afraid or at all unhappy to see the man. He only felt compelled to comply with his wishes. After years of training by the Long Death monks, and after his mind became clearer and sharper, the monks' hold on Aki was deteriorating. He became aware of what was truly happening in that awful place. The monks weren't just a group of creepy self-proclaimed outcasts, they were all devoted to the same goal: finding a way to prevent death itself. They studied victims intensely, keeping them teetering on the brink of death in order to observe the process. Aki was naturally horrified by their purpose, and regained full control of his thoughts and actions. He used his newly-sharpened skills to fight his way out of the monks' hideout and never looked back. However, once his mind was no longer clouded, he began noticing a figure almost always at the edge of his vision. He heard whispers when he laid his head down to sleep. He slowly came to the realization that this was his inheritance; the very same visions his father had described. But he refused to become fearful. Instead, he fought his own fear by ridding others of theirs. He became a sort of mercenary, and travelled across the land devoting himself to relieving the world of its evils. For a price, of course; a man has to make a living somehow."}]}

They came and offered to take him and teach him their fighting secrets.   At the monastery, Cricket blossomed. He became talkative and friendly, finding in the Hawks a new family, and was known as much for his good humor as his extraordinary talent as a fighter.

One day, the captain of the Marianne was being pressured to speed up the boat voyage. The merchants and cargo he was transporting was worth a massive amount of gold, and they were concerned with missing a Full Moon Festival to sell their goods.   Against the captain's better judgement, he sailed the ship directly into an oncoming storm. It was then a  sea monster ambushed the ship and tore it to pieces. As it began to pick off survivors, a massive thunderbolt came down from the heavens and severely wounded the creature, causing it to retreat without even touching a single sailor on board.  Hoi looked up. The clouds were already parting, and yet the thunderbolt had came and saved him regardless. As he swam over and clung to a piece of debris, he swore he saw a shimmering dolphin say, \"you're welcome.\"  His chance meeting with Father Ripplelake was caused by Hoi going on a drunken stumble through the streets, rambling about how no one would believe that he and his crew were saved by the \"shiny golden talking dolphin.\"  After sobering up the following morning, he discovered that Deep Sashelas had saved his life, and perhaps even chosen him to be his cleric.  Heart accepted, as he felt grateful for the god who saved his life. Father Ripplelake then mentored him, teaching him the Elvish language, martial proficiency, and how to be a divine conduit.  Hoi is now a holy man, repaying whom he believed to be Deep Sashelas, the elven god of the sea by serving him.  The rest of his faith, and even Father Ripplelake to an extent, sees Heart somewhat suspiciously, and even with contempt at the idea of a human attempting to worship and Elven god, when they and only they have ever truly heeded His teachings.   Deep Sashelas does not curry the favour of many followers, the hundred-year-war causing surface dwellers to turn their attentions and prayers inland than beyond the shores.  And the followers Deep Sashelas attracts are almost all Elven, or of Elvish descent. The other races tend to far favour the teachings of their own gods.  Heart understands the contempt towards him by the fellow members of his faith, but he largely has decided to ignore them, hoping to prove his own merits as a rightful cleric of Deep Sashlelas and spread His teachings by example.  He cannot persuade the world by words, and he lacks the force of a paladin. But he can live as a cleric doing good for the Duchy, and he knows that with enough good deeds and glory, he will not need to speak for the world to follow. "}]}

She's the sort of friend that would help you burn your own house down.  The only thing that's certain about her is that she's a liar.  Ask three of her friends where she was born, and you'd end up with four different answers.  The people closest to her know when she's telling the truth because that's the only time she sounds like she's lying. Take the following with that observation in mind.  Myka grew up in a human village with an absent father.  The common folk never really gave any mind to her lineage, but those 'in charge' sure did.  See, they had rules.  Some applied specifically to elves, and Myka have one foot in both worlds, ended up at the mercy of those in power who decided when which rule set applied to her and when it didn't.  She learned early on that laws are just words, and can be used just like any other words, to help or to hurt.  Mostly they're used to hurt; to hurt the common folk, to keep them poor and indebted.  There was an orphanage in her town run by a retired ranger of some sort. An older man ill-equipped to tend to children, but still gamely trying.  There was no law that helped him or the kids.  One of her friends lived there, and one day she went with her to visit and play.  It wasn't until she left to go home that she realized that the never *opened* anything.  The entire facility was open to the world.   Myka approached the old man and asked why that was, and he said, \"Well, I'm building this place myself.  Walls and a roof are more important than doors.  I've build it so that most of the rooms can stay warm, and the common area can stay cool. Whenever we get the supplies or can afford them, I'm sure we'll get to it.\"    Well that was some bullshit, she thought.  Her house had at least THREE doors.  That night, while her mother slept, she disassembled front door to her house, dragged it to the orphanage, and left it leading in the aperture.    It wasn't until she was almost home and saw the empty doorway that she realized just how angry her mother was going to be.  She thought quickly, if her house had had three doors, surely those large fancy houses in those places she wasn't allowed to go - because rules - would have even more to spare.  It was already late, verging on early morning, so she didn't have much time!  She snuck out and up over the walls intended to keep people like her out, and discretely tapped at windows until she found one loose enough to open wide enough for a door to be dragged through, and empty enough not to be caught immediately. Fortunately, these homes were way to large for the number of people living in them, so finding an empty room was not much of a challenge.  After removing the door, shoving it out the window and back over the wall, damaging but not destroying it on the way, she managed to drag it back to her home and install it.  The next morning, she realized what was wrong: the door was way too fancy for her home and stuck out.  Never mind her mother would have - and did - notice immediately.  And despite the space population density in the richer part of town, the residents did in fact notice that an entire door was missing, a window was open, and things were torn up.  So she ran.  Grabbed the few things she thought she would need: some clothes, a knife, a sack of food, and she ran.  She lied her way into a caravan, and... well, here we are.  Where are we going again?"}]}

Stel's best friend is her 200lb mastiff K'alvin, whom she found as a puppy and adored as he was the only thing smaller than her at the monastary... he is no longer smaller than her...  Stel has completed her training and has chosen to travel the realms to use her gifts to help others. She refuses to wear shoes. Stel can't remember how she got to Dragon's Pool, but she dreams of being carried accross the sea. Stel maked clothes and bathrobes for visitors to the hot springs at Dragon's Pool.  Stel never knew her father but her mother had told her that Jak is a trader of great renown and was traveling in far off lands. Her idea for the travel cart came from his famous trader cart, which she imagined to be like a palace on wheels. She hopes one day she will find him and see his great wagon.  Dragon's Pools is built onto the side of a dormant volcano on the island of Ruathym, although the erruption has always occured on the far side of the mountain. It was once home to a Silver dragon from Shou Lung who took the form of a Shou woman and the name Wen Xiao, Wen Xiao. Wen Xiao passed on her knowledge of the martial arts of Shou Lung to a number of accolytes. Wen Xiao had the bath house built on the hot springs to help fund the monastery.  Master Qinelis Mossmire is around 450 years old and is in poor health.  The only thing left of her family is a tiny gnome-crafted music box that plays a song she dimly remembers from her childhood."}]}

The backstory should revolve around his upbringing and early adventures as a druid. Remember, the character's name is Sker Íshvalr, his class is druid, and he belongs to the dwarf race."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Notes: Both names derived from Old Norse: first name pronounced like the English word “scare,” last name pronounced ees-kvAl-r. Don’t ask me why they pronounce h like k before a v, but they do.  Also, \"Martian\" refers to being from our campaign world's sea-faring country of Mars, not the irl planet.)  Sker was born the same as all Martians, on a boat. Now I could lie, and wax poetic of how he entered the world in the throes of a raging storm, amongst a tumult of waves and wind that threatened to rip the very clothes from your back, and this was to be an omen for his rancorous disposition and later druidic calling… but the truth is he was born on a clear day in mid-summer, and his early childhood was quite uneventful. No one can say where his surliness came from.   To outside observers, he seemed to bear the weight of the world on his shoulders, and the weight of ice in his heart, although anyone who cared enough to see past his exterior quickly realized there was no malice behind his barking. Still, his hard abrasiveness was enough to earn him his True Name.  Dwarves of Mars do not name their young at birth, but prefer to wait and watch until a True Name arises that fully encompasses the individual’s core. This first name stays with them always, as a label of sorts, and it is unthinkable to shorten it or alter it in any way. Over time, dwarves may earn additional names commemorating moments of personal growth or achievement. Their full name is their full story.   “Sker” is the dwarven word for a small rocky protrusion jutting up out of otherwise calm waters, and that indeed is who he is at heart – a solid, stubborn mass sticking out like a sore thumb amongst his peers; a hardened, inhospitable one-man mountain impeding the natural flow. Yet, though he is a dedicated curmudgeon, he also exudes a sense of unwavering strength and competency, with his words as wise as they are biting, allowing him to act as a firm anchor point for those willing to trust him.  (It should be noted that non-dwarves who meet him usually assume his name is a purely physically-descriptive moniker, claiming his dark stocky frame looks uncannily like a rocky outcropping when he is treading water. They are not entirely wrong on that point.)  He earned his second name as a wee lad of 26 years. The story goes it was the dead of night in the dead of winter, and he had just stumbled onto the deck of the ship in a drunken haze, carrying two bottles of dwarven ale and singing loudly of the many ways the rest of the crew could bugger off. At the peak of his accompanying gesticulations to this little ditty, he lost his balance and fell right over the side of the ship. Though the sailors on night watch tried desperately to locate him amid the chopping waters, it was as though he had been swallowed whole by the sea.  Nine nights later he was found by a passing trade ship, floating unconscious in the ice. When he came to, his skin was completely numb, his head hurt, his joints ached, he had difficulties hearing, and he claimed to have no memory of what had transpired during his time in the sea. The merchants wrote it off as a case of the bends coupled with extreme elemental exposure, and went about trying to track down his kin.  Later, back on board his ship, his family noticed he was different, changed beyond just a simple case of decompression sickness. The merchants’ healer had alleviated his physical symptoms, but still the partial hearing loss persisted with no apparent medical or magical cause. He also seemed eerily calmer than normal, quieter, gazing out at the water with a faraway reverence that no one could explain. It was clear he remembered something, but he refused to talk about what happened.   Over the course of the next few weeks, rumors abounded on the ship. “He was punished by the gods for his terrible demeanor and even more terrible singing!” some said of his partial deafness. “No,” others joked, “he almost died, but the ocean saved him because he offered it two bottles of our best ale!”   Still he kept the truth to himself.  Despite his injury and the ordeal he went through, he couldn’t wait to get back into the water; it was almost as if he felt more comfortable there than on the ship. It was only when he started publicly correcting the elders on matters relating to their surroundings, matters he should only have a passing knowledge of (their maps of the region, the local environment and weather patterns, the sea creatures they encountered… ) that they started suspecting what had really happened.  Their suspicions were confirmed when, while their ship was under attack by a band of pirates, he unwittingly shot ice from his hands in self-defense.  As the pirates turned tail in fear, it was clear to the wisest of the ship’s leaders that Sker had formed a mystical connection with the frozen ocean, and was able to channel its power and magic to his own ends. They gave him the name “Íshvalr,” meaning “whale of the icy waters” (inspired by that great Jötunn of legend), to mark his new life as a creature permanently tied to the sea and the elements.  Since he was still a child by dwarven standards, his parents felt uncomfortable sending him off for training, so they instead invited a respected druid by the name of Aðalbjörn Sævarr (pronounced ah-thahl-byurn sai-vahr, and meaning “noble bear” “defender of the sea”) to travel with their ship and instruct the boy in the basics.  So life continued for a time. Eventually, Sker, a quick study, mastered all there was to be taught, and Aðalbjörn recommended he seek out further guidance from the Order of Benthos, the largest association of druids in that region of Mars. His parents grudgingly consented, knowing there was nothing more they could do for him, and recognizing that a rookie magic user on board was more of a liability than an asset.  Thus it came to pass that Sker saw out the rest of his childhood on an unmarked forested island bordering Althean waters, deepening his bond with the natural world and learning all he could from the small conclave of masters there. During that time he never managed to endear himself to an animal companion, or any animal, really, since they seemed to react to him in much the same way as the people he had known. Instead, he grew to worship the ice-covered ocean, seeing its neutral coldness and harshness, which somehow still managed to support the lives around it, as a reflection of his own temperament.  At 40 he was conscripted into five years of naval service, the standard for all who come of age in Mars. He found the strict discipline and chain of command antithetical to his nature, and constantly butted heads with his superiors. At the end of his required tour, he was happy to part ways with the military, and they were happier to see him go.  For the past 18 years, he has hopped around from ship to ship as a freelance sailor and cartographer - sometimes on a fishing vessel, sometimes engaging in underwater prospecting or dungeoneering expeditions. He has gained the nickname “The Irascible Old Man,” due to being brusque and hard-of-hearing. Though he is generally seen as unpleasant to work with, he is recommended based solely on his skills and wide range of magical abilities. Also, there may or may not be a running bet at the local portside bar to see how long crews will put up with him.  Catchphrase: “I don’t give a goshdarn damn!” "}]}

He is a half-orc fighter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mek Leth’Osh was born to Tagg Leth’Osh and Marianna Urquart on a muggy summer night nineteen years prior.  Her unwed parents, both adventurers by trade, had been a bit too “over-celebratory” and not quite so “over-celibatory” after the conclusion of a particularly arduous quest.  Upon discovering her condition, and weighing the possibility of finding employment as a rogue with a -25 modifier to stealth due to “screaming baby,” Marianna promptly inclined to leave her unnamed daughter in the care of the child’s father.  Henceforth nine months later, Tagg was not-so-pleasantly surprised to find a small shrieking bundle carefully laid inside the hut of his village, with only a small note, “Thanks for the memories Big T, but I believe this loot belongs to you,” as explanation.    The village didn’t think twice about her mixed parentage, as Tagg’s well-known heroic deeds had put him in a class above reproach.  And a few years later, Tagg found he rather enjoyed being a father.  His hardened warrior’s face softened with laugh lines as his small toddling daughter tried to put on his helmet, and proceeded to fall over due to the relative weigh of metal to child.    Tagg dazzled his young daughter with stories of his adventuring days: how he had single-handedly slain an entire band of marauding kobolds, how her mother had deservedly gotten a face-full of magic missiles when she tried to sneak a peak into a trapped chest they were supposed to be guarding, and how he had distracted a mock dragon long enough for her mother to sneak around behind it and deal a crippling blow.    Mek doted on her father, who was slowly starting to show his age, and vowed to make him proud by becoming a fierce fighter herself.  At the age of eight she begged him to let her learn swordplay.  Although he was hesitant to let her do anything dangerous (his fatherly nature winning against his Orcish bloodrage), he soon could be found dueling sticks with Mek in the village center (every so often exclaiming “Argh, you got me!” and falling overdramatically to the ground amidst his daughter’s fits of giggles.)    By the time she was thirteen, Mek was starting to show signs of womanhood.  She was easily considered the prettiest girl in the village, owing to the fact that her human blood had softened her Orcish features into something approximating femininity.  She was hard-pressed to find any suitors, however, because Tagg seemed to stare down any boy that looked even slightly amorously at his daughter (much to his daughter’s pouting).  At the age of sixteen, Mek was “accepted” into the Guard of the Crimson Paw – a special branch of the village guard allegedly tasked with “escorting village elders to and from the big city” which lay a half-day’s journey away.  The elders went once or twice a month to stock up on hard-to-come-by supplies for the village, and to sell local trade goods.  She was told the journey to the city was long and difficult, and that she had to be ever-vigilant for danger.  (In actuality, though, the village elders simply did not want teenagers sneaking off to the city alone.  They had cunningly devised the “guard” as a way for teenagers to have a safe and sanctioned way to travel there without knowing that it was they themselves who were the ones being chaperoned.  The adults in the village are in on the joke, and persist in telling dramatic lies about the trip being dangerous to further discourage wanderlust.  The elders feel it is a win-win situation, however, as they are happy for the company, and they enjoy seeing the teenagers proud faces brimming with responsibility.) Tagg, of course knowing full well the true aims of the guard, decided to make a big show of being proud of his daughter anyway because he didn’t want to ruin her enthusiasm.  He gifted her with her first suit of armor, a shining breastplate with an emblazoned paw print on the front.  Now nineteen, Mek still assists with the guard’s “educational field trips.”  Being an adult, she helps the elders watch over the “new recruits” who are visiting the city for the first time, delighting in teasing them with wild stories about potentially ferocious bugbears and hobgoblins who might be waiting to ambush them at any minute.    She can still feel her parents’ adventuring blood pumping in her veins, though, and wishes that one of those tall tales would actually come true so she could finally prove herself as a fighter and make her father genuinely proud.  However, the closest thing to action she has seen so far was when a particularly stupid band of thieves tried to intercept their group on the road.  The scoundrels were instantly caught in a reverse gravity spell from one of the elders, as the whole of the Crimson Paw looked on and roared with laughter. "}]}

However, his 17 year old daughter, Orelka, has proven somewhat of a problem child...]  From an early age, it was known that Orelka was a “special” child.  Her great-great-great grandfather had been some sort of air-based outsider, and it was very clear she had inherited his temperament.  Calm and gentle at one moment, she would fly off the handle at the slightest provocation.  She would also spend hours perched on the roof spires like a gargoyle, claiming she liked to be near the sky.

She was raised at a well-known dueling academy near the Sea of Fallen Stars, where she attended classes in fencing, history, and etiquette along with the children of nobles and rich merchants. Most kids only stayed for a few years, but the academy was the only home Kira ever knew.   She excelled in her schoolwork, and she also learned a few stealthier arts thanks to the kinds of things that lightly supervised teenagers tend to get up to while at boarding school. She and her friends let themselves into the school's administrative offices one night and learned that Kira had been left at the school at four years of age by someone who paid her entire tuition and fees in advance, but there was no record of who this mysterious benefactor might be. Kira began to believe that she was born out of wedlock to someone who had enough of a sense of responsibility to see to her welfare, but they clearly didn't want to be part of her life. That was fine by her though.   When she graduated, she was planning to become an instructor at the school, but a pair of strange men arrived and explained they were taking her home. Even if they were on the level, Kira had no interest in rejoining the family who abandoned her. Unfortunately the men weren't inclined to take no for an answer. They tied her up and tossed her in a carriage. By the time she was able to escape, she decided it wasn't a great idea to go back to her school. That's the first place they'd look, and her presence would cause trouble for the people who'd raised her.  Kira began to travel, and she moved from place to place often. Sometimes she still saw signs of pursuit. But after a year without any trace of being followed, she believed her supposed family may have given up hope of recovering her.   She joined up with an adventuring group, and they did fairly well for themselves. Kira thought they were people she could rely on. Then they stumbled into a tavern and overheard the wrong set of rumors, and the next thing she knew, her companions had her drugged and bound and were looking around for a potential ransom. After a few nearly successful escape attempts, the group decided not to wait on the people who were looking for Kira. They found a group of slavers who knew there was a price on her head, and then they sold her.  The slavers were secretly working for a medusa who had the habit of petrifying some of the more interesting people she captured. Kira was turned to stone for several years, until she was rescued by a different group of adventurers who'd hunted down the medusa.  She'd been hidden away in the medusa's garden for long enough that Kira now hopes her family, or whoever they were, has stopped looking for her."}]}

Growing up in a peaceful and sheltered setting:  Priceless  My childhood was simple.  The kind you would expect of any other Goliath youth.  We played, we hunted, we shared in challenge and honor, we lamented the loss of the once-proud, and we sought for ways to live life as fully as possible.  Occasionally we ran into a Dwarven outpost, or passed by a group of adventurous Humans, and we would trade our goods for weapons and crafts.  Mostly, though, we kept to ourselves.    I progressed within the tribe from berry-gatherer to weaver, then to assistant den-mother, and finally to hunter.  I was gruff, opinionated, homely, not well-spoken, and generally off-putting, but by the time I was 18, my skill with the business-end of a hammer was enough to gain the honor of my tribe – and the heart of a man.    Our Dawncaller, Gul’mok, fancied me for his wife.  I told him he could have me, but only if he could beat me in a climbing race – a race I did not anticipate losing.  I was over-confident in my skills, having never lost a fair match in hunting, wrestling, or rock scaling.    We agreed to a race up the cliff-face and back - whoever touched the ground first, won.  I was already halfway down by the time he’d even scaled the summit. In an act of desperation and love-blind bravado, he jumped off the top of the cliff instead of climbing to the ground, and while he did in fact reach the bottom before me, he broke his leg in the process.  I sighed at him and his childish stupidity, realizing I never technically specified he had to climb both ways. Yet, in that moment I was also touched by how hard he was willing to fight for me, and decided to honor our bargain and marry him after all.    He spent the next two weeks being shunned while he recovered from his injury.  During that time I only looked at him once, but he was smiling that ear-wide grin of his.    By all accounts we were a happy couple, always challenging each other, but never fighting.  A year later I bore him a son, but it was born early and weak.  It was the second-hardest lament I have endured in my life.    Later that year, Gul’mok woke early to sing the dawn praises, as was his custom every morning.  I left a while later with the hunting party, but when I returned that evening, Gul’mok was still absent.  He should have reached camp hours before me.  Suddenly I heard my name, gasped and hollow like a cave wind, and I turned.  Gul’mok was crawling into camp.  I could barely recognize him, so coated in blood was he.  He tried to speak, but all I could make out was “Move...camp...Orcs...hundreds...”  The Orcs had always stayed north of our mountains, kept in check by the Goblins of Hob.  It was never our fight or our concern...until now.  The fact that the Orcs were boldly pushing as far south as here meant that Hob’s power must be weakening.  If they were attacking and invading any peoples who stood in their way, without provocation or ethics, than we had a large-scale problem brewing.    Our tribe, while harsh, had always lived life by rules and fairness.  These Orcs, however, lived by little more than violence and depravity – mere savages whose breath was as dirty as their fighting. With Hob’s defense cracking, someone had to step in and uphold the balance of order, to remain a steadfast wall in the face of impending destabilization, and somehow this called for more than a good shunning. The elders were not going to charge into a fight they could not win, though, and immediately made plans to move camp again.    I knew Gul’mok would not survive the night, let alone a move, so I asked that we be exiled together rather than leaving with the rest of the tribe.  I bit my tongue as I watched my people embark on a path of fear, running with their tails between their legs while our enemies went unchecked, while my husband’s assailants went unchecked. I was vehement and filled with a vengeance I could not contain.  The Orcs had crossed a line, and I would not let any more suffer like my husband had.  In the morning I planned to seek out a way to bring the Orcs to justice. Even if I stood alone, I would protect and restore our lands, our way of life, our honor.    I would always remember the cacophony of that night – the cries of the lamenters amid the chaos of packing and carting – fading into a still silence as in one pivotal hour all I had ever known vanished down a darkened mountain path, leaving my world shattered.    Alone with my husband, sitting by the smoldering embers of the dying fire, I tried to bandage his wounds.  I knew it was in vain, but it kept my mind focused.  We fell asleep in each other’s arms, and I awoke holding death.  Once-proud Vae’Ulov Feast-Bringer re-forged into exiled Vae’Ulov Dawn-Widow.    I set off toward the only peoples I thought might aid me in my cause, an outpost of Dwarven border guards we were on friendly terms with.  It was a one week hike south through the mountain passes, and I was never very good with directions.  It took me twelve days to find my way.  When I reached the outpost, the Dwarves were in full battle gear.  Apparently word had spread of the Orcs uprising, and the Dwarves had sighted incursions into their own territory.  Admitting we had a common enemy, I asked if I could help.  The outpost allowed me to camp with them, and in exchange for aiding them with hunting and standing watch, they offered military training so I could better defend myself.    Over the next 169 days, they bored me with stories of their kings and nobles, taught me to ride a horse and wear plated armor, equipped me with gear of unspeakable craftsmanship, and did their best to “culture” me as we fought side by side.    When the news finally came that Hob’s last stronghold had fallen, rumors began to spread that a group of warriors from every race were gathering into one untied army to make a definitive stand against the Orcish hoard.  I was invited to ride along with the local Dwarven envoy, having proven myself an able-bodied ally... "}]}

Using his charm and acumen he managed to curry favor with the king, earning himself a title in exchange for his contacts and expert council. With her grandfather’s aid, the king was able to expand trade routes further than ever before, importing exotic luxuries and a wealth of new information.  However, after the king’s second son murdered the heir apparent and attempted to assassinate his father in a play for the throne, Gwynedd’s family knew their privileged life was on the verge of toppling. Before word of the kingdom’s troubles spread, Gwynedd’s grandfather secured a betrothal for his son, then a boy of only ten, to a young Elven noble far across the sea. He had hoped to train his son in the mercantile trade, but the boy was too spoiled and lacking in wits to be any kind of protégé, so potentially marrying him off to cement a bond with the Elves was the only use that could come from him.  Eventually the prince succeeded in his machinations and ascended to the throne. Her grandfather visited the usurper in the hope he could somehow continue to live in the lap of luxury, but the new king was bold and arrogant, and rejected the old man’s help. However, by a stroke of good fortune, the prince soon took an Elven bride, and her grandfather used his influence with the Elven people to win her ear and monopolize trade routes between the two kingdoms for the next several years.  Gwynedd’s father, now a strapping young officer of 18, finally came of age to marry his betrothed, but shortly after the wedding, Gwynedd’s grandfather fell victim to a freak storm and his ship was lost at sea. Her father was now the sole heir to a vast trade empire, suddenly making him a very wealthy and powerful noble - a wealthy and powerful noble with the business sense and charisma of a decomposing turnip.  He squandered most of the money away on lavish gifts for his new wife, who, it turned out, was just as much of a ninny as him, and within a few years they had run the company near into the ground through mismanagement and incompetence. By the time Gwynedd was born, the family was destitute and cut off from all lines of credit and influence, yet still clung proudly to their noble title.  Lady Gwynedd was a child cursed by fate. Born with exceptional beauty and flawless talent, she was scorned by women and objectified by men. Seeing in her gifts a last ditch effort to regain favor with the other noble houses, her parents decided to use her as a pawn. She was trained to sing, dance, recite poems, and play a variety of instruments, and then paraded from parlor to parlor like some exotic caged bird. Admirers fought for her presence at their parties, and showered her with presents (all of which were pawned to make ends meet and keep up appearances).  As she grew up, she was better able to hone her skills to captivate and charm her audience, and soon had a following of potential wealthy suitors. When she reached the minimum legal age, her parents married her off to the wealthiest of the bunch, expecting her to supply them with the necessary income to maintain their immoderate lifestyle.  Her new husband was an abusive drunkard with no respect for her, though, and she saw a chance to escape after he got himself killed in an alcohol-induced altercation. She was sick of being a pawn, and disgusted with the petty childishness of her family and the rest of the corrupt nobility that approved any and all methods of keeping themselves in power - even to the point of letting a murderer sit on the throne and letting liches infiltrate the city.  She decided to take her husband’s wealth and her freedom into her own hands, transforming herself into a secretive vigilante, “The Mask of Thorns.”   In her new role, she helped a group of adventurers rid the city of the undead threat, then turned her attention to the arrogant elite and lowly bandits that ran rampant through the streets, both having an equal hand in making life miserable for the common people.   Her calling card was a stem of thorns, symbolizing the choked and stagnant state of the kingdom. Though her punishments were harsh, they were non-violent – her goal was to shock and scare (and possibly humiliate), not to kill.  (Perhaps she should have studied combat more effectively, though, as she met an untimely end at the hands of a 4-armed sniper during the very first wave of the demonic invasion of the city. Trying to hide behind a well in an open courtyard is apparently not sufficient to avoid impalement by a guy double-wielding bows.) "}]}

To him, dad jokes are real, pizza is scary, and his best friend in the world is his axe named Helga.  But Mr. Giggles isn’t crazy.  Rather, he’s just clueless how to live among people.  It all began many years ago when Giggles was born Felldrop Smartbriar to the Smartbriar clan of Halflings in the village of Forgetmenot.  Felldrop’s father Spelldrop and his mother Dropdrop (known as Dropsie) had a long history of eccentricity, even in a place as weird as Forgetmenot...a town that was named, incidentally, after the regional government forget all about it for over a century due to a drunken scribe’s geographic oversight.  Located high in the Neverease Mountains, Forgetmenot was visited only by local yak herders,  lost mountain climbers, and holy pilgrims.  Among even this village of loners, Spell and Dropsie were even further ostracized.  Spell, an herbalist and tea maker, had congenital narcolepsy, and would often fall down in the streets due to what his neighbors referred to as the sleeping sickness.  Spelldrop explained away his episodes with regular exhortations about being up late the previous night, or inadvertently mixing his herbs.  Hence, the nickname Spelldrop.  (No one recalls, nor cares, what his real name was and because Spelldrop secretly liked the attention, he avoided his real name as well.)  Dropsie, like her husband, had a moniker that fit her personality.  She was clumsy.  But because Dropdrop was her given name (something about how her parents liked hearing the sound of rain, which itself was unusual so high in the mountains), it’s difficult to say if the name made her clumsy or if her parents were simply augurs.  Either way, if a villager wanted something broken, he’d hand it to Dropsie.  Spelldrop’s friends tried warning him of his girlfriend’s powers inopportune powers but, alas, he had a narcoleptic episode in the middle of their speech and they neglected to finish the story when he awoke.  Conventional wisdom suggests either that Dropsie performed one of her clumsy maneuvers on her son or his father had an episode atop him, or perhaps both.  No matter how you cut it, though, Felldrop never had a chance at a normal life.  This led to much resentment and anger.  By the time he was thirteen, Felldrop was known for his temper, and the local boys would tease him mercilessly just to watch him fly into rages.  A passing holy man saw one of these events and gave Felldrop a small hand axe, thinking it would allow the boy to focus his passion.  Instead, it led to bloodshed: Felldrop slaughtered every small animal he could catch.  The town boys quickly learned to avoid him, especially when he had the axe with him.  And in a village as small as Forgetmenot, this was no mean feat!  At twenty, Felldrop had proven that he was incapable of being around others.  His friends had long since abandoned him and even his parents were scared to be around him.  He had taken to talking to his axe, which he’d named Helga, and he treated it like a girlfriend, often being seen caressing it in public.  On the eve of his 21st birthday, then, it was no surprise when Felldrop announced that he would be leaving Forgetmenot with the next yak herding caravan that passed through town.  Felldrop traveled with the yak herders only a short time.  Within two weeks, he’d realized that there was far more to the work than just yak wool, and far more to his temper than just small animals.  It came to a head one night when he attacked one of the yaks.  The animal, far larger than he, gave him a good drubbing.  Felldrop ran off into the night, smelling of yak and urine.  For many months, Felldrop roamed the lands, eating wild berries and scavenging raw meat from smelly carcasses.  In that time, he saw no other people, and the wild rages of passion quickly overcame him.  By the time he wandered into another civilized town, Axeborough (a fitting name) 300 miles from Forgetmenot, he had lost the ability both to speak the common tongue and to interact properly with other humanoids.  He had become a full barbarian.  For approximately three years, Felldrop lived on the outskirts of Axeborough, only rarely interacting with other humanoids.  It wasn’t until a band of orc raiders attacked the town that Felldrop was drawn back into social contact.  When the orcs attacked the town, a vicious battle ensued.  Felldrop watched from a safe distance and was amazed at the prowess of the raiders.  They mowed down the town guard with such ferocity and precision that Felldrop was awestruck.  Afterward, when the fighting had ended and the raiders had made off into the night with their booty, Felldrop gave chase.  He came upon their came about an hour later and walked in like he owned the place.  He was quickly overwhelmed and tied to a roasting spit.  The orcs danced around him and laughed, forcing him into deeper and deeper anger.  When the tide of emotion finally broke, Felldrop let out a primal yell, snapped his bonds, lifted the roasting pin over his head and plunged it into the chest of the nearest orc.  Before any of the orcs could react, their leader, a half-Orc man in his fifties or so, approached Felldrop.  He admired the little runt’s tenacity and decided to teach him how to be a raider, especially since they currently had an opening thanks to Felldrop’s anger.  The leader of the orcs, named Kruger, was himself a barbarian, and he carried an icy hammer on his back and wore little more than the orcs themselves.  He was as battle-hardened and as bloodthirsty as they were, and so Felldrop couldn’t have asked for a better teacher.  And yet Kruger was merciless to Felldrop, always inciting him to anger and always at unlikely moments.  Kruger’s approach was to keep Felldrop guessing, but Felldrop was never able to make the cognitive leap required to read a scene and to surmise how events might play out.  As a result, Felldrop would go into his battle rages at all the wrong times, such as when eating, or getting ready for bed, or doing his business in the bushes.  Kruger found this all kinds of hysterical and never bothered to inform Felldrop of the right way to do things.  Felldrop spent several years traveling with Kruger until the band was decimated by a patrol of Elven cavalry, which had been hunting them for some time.  Kruger was killed in the battle and Felldrop was “saved” when the warriors thought he was a child.  Felldrop eventually got away from the elves, who had tried to adopt him and teach him their ways, and has been wandering since.  On the rare occasion that he crossed paths with other humanoids, most were drawn to his passion but put off by his anger.  And, in the end, Felldrop was left wanting something he couldn’t even name.  Eventually, he attempted to draw people to him to ward off his loneliness by adopting the moniker “Mr. Giggles”.  Some kids once called him that and he likes the idea that if anyone laughs at him, it will be the last thing that person ever does. "}]}

Brak the Cursed was born in the year 6108 to Lorkus, a female Orc Shaman once revered by her tribe for both her visions and for the herbal healing potions she would prepare during times of disease or battle.  However, Lorkus fell into disfavor with the tribal elders due to the bizarre circumstances surrounding Brak’s conception and birth.    Shortly before Brak’s conception, Lorkus began to have visions and dreams of an impending doom that would be visited upon her tribe or perhaps all of Middle Earth.  During one of her visions, she was visited by a human glowing in blue light who laid with her.  At first she dismissed the event as a mere vision, but then 6 months later she gave birth to a thin Half-Orc baby with strange glyph birthmarks covering his back.  Despite all previous service that Lorkus had provided to her tribe, the elders saw Lorkus’ vision, her mysterious pregnancy, and Brak’s strange birthmarks as bad omens.  The baby, they declared, was cursed with what appeared to be Elvish Ruins.  Lorkus and her newborn baby were banished from the tribe.   For months Lorkus travelled alone through the wilds on the outskirts of both Orc and Human society.  She eked out a meager existence that allowed her to nurse Brak, but slowly drained her reserves.  One night she was attacked by wolves.  While she protected Brak from harm, Lorkus was mortally wounded.    With her life force draining and knowing that any Orc will likely make a sacrifice out of Brak, Lorkus carried Brak in the direction of the nearest human settlement.  As twilight breaks she found herself on a farm at the outskirts of New Breverik.  With luck, the farmer was blind and did not appear to recognize her Orcish nature.  The kindly farmer took them both in and he tended to Lorkus’ wounds as best he could, but it was clear from the moment of her arrival that she was on borrowed time.  Grateful for his kindness in her final moments, Lorkus confesses her story and her nature to the kindly farmer who promises to care for Brak after her passing.    After her passing, the farmer placed Lorkus’ effects aside and buried her on his farmstead.  The farmer, Olaf, nursed and raised Brak as his own.  At first, the people of New Breverik were disturbed by Olaf’s young ward and many complaints are made before the town council.  But the council was unable to discover any precedence to act upon and tells the people of New Breverik that they must honor and respect the decisions that Olaf makes; especially those that are made upon and regarding his farmstead.  While the people of New Breverik were never truly accepting of Brak, they eventually accept Olaf’s decision and resign themselves to the fact that Brak will be sharing their valley for the foreseeable future.     At the age of 10 Brak is large enough to start running the farm under the management and tutelage of Olaf.  Brak works the fields and tries to avoid contact with the humans of the valley and only occasionally goes into New Breverik.  In the evenings, Olaf teaches Brak reading, writing, and arithmetic and is pleasantly surprised at Brak’s ability to quickly learn complex concepts.    After Brak’s arrival the farmstead only retains one regular visitor, Skallagrím.  Skallagrím is a local herbalist who is fast friends with Olaf and is fascinated with Brak’s story.  While Brak is still a youngster, Skallagrím discovers that Brak has an amazing gift for preparing herbal remedies, perhaps inherited from his mother.  During his visits, Skallagrím teaches Brak about herbs and their preparation and application.  When Brak is a young man of 16 years he witnesses an event of immense cruelty in the town of New Breverik which reminds him that Human culture and Orc culture are not divided by that wide of a gulf.  Unn, one of the daughters of the farmer Eirik, is accused of witchcraft, sorcery, and wizardry after she cures a boy's leg which had been crushed under an ox cart.  After a perfunctory trial in front of the town elders, and despite the fact that no one was harmed by her magics, she is sentenced to death by fire in the town's center.  Olaf Doomhammer, New Breverik’s high priest to Thor and also a Dwarf, tried to interfere with the town elders’ judgment and the building of the pyre; however, the people of New Breverik feared Unn’s potential magic more than they feared Thor’s potential wrath.  Olaf is held fast while Unn is burned alive.    During Olaf’s waning years, Brak comforts him by preparing herbal medicinals and poultices that alleviate Olaf’s chronic pain.  In the year 6129 Olaf passes, but not before performing two final acts.  First, Olaf passes onto Brak the possessions that Lorkus had left behind when she died on the farmstead years before.  Second, Olaf arranges for Skallagrím to take Brak on as his understudy.  Brak buries Olaf on the farmstead and quietly departs for Skallagrím’s camp.  Skallagrím lives in an abandoned mining camp in the mountains just south of New Breverik where he roams the rough terrain in search of the herbs, roots, and other ingredients for the herbal treatments that he sells to the citizens of the valley.  Brak spends a short time with Skallagrim, but is restless following the death of Olaf.  Brak decides that it is time to try and make a connection with his Orcish side and sets off to locate the tribe of his mother.    Brak spends a few years in Orcish society, but ultimately determines that he is even more of an outcast there than in New breverik.  Both Humans and Orcs shun and ostracize Brak, but at least Human society is filled with a range of viewpoints and philosophies on the world that range from good to evil and from lawful to chaotic; here Brak at least fit on the spectrum.  In Orcish society, Brak only witnessed slavish obedience to cruel and evil masters.  In 6131 he returns to New Breverik and to Skallagrim.  Skallagrim is happy to see Brak return.  Shortly after, Skallagrím takes Brak into his confidence and shows Brak that he, Skallagrím, is in actuality a Wizard who has retired from adventuring following a tragic encounter with a Landshark that killed his friends and left him as the sole survivor.    Since moving in with Skallagrím, Brak has found it necessary to travel into town more often in order to make purchases for the camp and while delivering the herbal remedies that Skallagrim makes for the people of the valley.  Brak has been befriended by a man in town named Fordin.  Fordin runs a small business where he employs mule barges and teamsters to ferry goods up and down the river.  Fordin’s enterprise is responsible for about 15% of the river traffic in and out of New Breverik and his travels provide him with a greater understanding of the world's diversity and a more open mind regarding Brak’s Half-Orc nature.  Brak begins to learn the ways of magic.  Skallagrím’s first lesson for Brak is to be very careful with whom he takes into his confidence regarding his studies of the magic arts.  He is reminded of the trial and punishment of Unn.  Beyond the simple teachings of the magic arts, Skallagrím shares two more things with Brak; his theory of magic and his compendium of renowned users of magic.  Skallagrím’s theory of magic is based upon years of study and travel and the review of ancient manuscripts.  On occasion, Halfdan Runeaxe, a cleric to Thor, has been of great assistance to Skallagrím.  Halfdan is a Dwarf attached to New Breverik’s Vigilance Committee and is also a collector of rare and ancient manuscripts.  On many occasions he has assisted Skallagrím with the research and formation of his theory.  Skallagrím is confident that his theory accounts for all the evidence that he has accumulated.  Skallagrím’s theory is only known by a few magic using friends that he has shared it with, and Skallagrím admits that not many other users of magic appear to care about the potential sources of their powers.        Skallagrím’s compendium of users of magic is based mostly upon his review of Halfdan’s manuscripts.  It represents knowledge that he was not initially looking for, but could not ignore or avoid as he was researching his theory of magic.  He felt it best to record some short notes regarding each user of magic that he encountered in the ancient scripts.  Very recently Brak and Skallagrím have noticed that Brak’s dreams occasionally appear to be related to events that occur in the future.  Skallagrím believes that Brak may have inherited these abilities from his mother and has begun to study Brak in his sleep to see if he can determine how and when such predictive dreams are triggered.

Astrid is a human paladin."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Astrid  It is the year 6133.  Your first memory is from the year 5783, the end of the Fourth age of Chaos and the beginning of the Fourth Age of Mankind.  You were discovered wandering the wooded hills in the southern reaches of Middle Earth by a patrol of humans; though you have a vague sense that you had been wandering in a daze through the greater region for weeks if not months.  The humans surprised you while you were feeding on a recent catch and they would later relate to you that you were feral in appearance and action and that it took the entire party to subdue you.    The humans took you back to their commune, a settlement of several hundred humans hidden in the middle of the Hyborean Bog.  According to stories, songs, and lore of the commune, it had been founded near the beginning of the Fourth Age of Chaos by several local farming communities that had been overrun by Orcs, Goblins and more.  At first they were excited to see another Human as their commune had not seen outsiders in approximately 25 years.  Their patrols had been encountering fewer and fewer Orcs, Goblins and the like and the discovery of a Human seemed like a good omen.  However, their initial excitement waned when they discovered you were not Human and turned to disappointment and suspicion when they discovered they could also not classify you as Elf or Half-Elf.    Despite their disappointment, the commune nursed you back to health.  Over the course of a few weeks your senses were gradually restored and your feral nature became recessive.  The commune was organized along traditional male and female roles which didn’t sit right with you, but it seemed to be a voluntary arrangement by both sexes so you swallowed what felt to you like an injustice in order to keep the peace.  Restless, eager to find clues to your past, and desiring to prove your worth; you volunteered for every patrol as soon as your mental and physical health were restored.       While the patrols did not lead you to any clues regarding your past, you did prove your worth to the commune and allayed most of their suspicions.  Month after month you patrolled and each month the patrols extended out further and further before they encountered signs of Orcs and Goblins.  In the year 6134, following months of patrols without a single encounter, the men of the commune voted and determined that it was time to leave the bog and resettle the fertile farm valleys to the north.  You helped the commune organize, move, and found a farming community which they named Everdale.  Shortly after founding Everdale, the Human patrols encountered a community of Hobbits and regular trade commenced.  With trade, the Humans had their first taste of beer, a luxury they went without in the bog, in nearly 2000 years.  The men quickly determined that the women of the community should not be allowed to drink and just when you were about to approach the town elders to voice your concerns, you came across a man who was beating his wife in the streets.    It seems that he had been drunk the night before and had returned to his home where he demanded his wife honor her matrimonial obligations despite her protestations.  The next morning the husband was appalled to discover that his wife had entered her cycle.  It was forbidden in the community for women to share a bed with their husbands when they were menstruating.  The husband dragged his wife from the bed by her hair and was beating her in the streets as he continued to drag her to the town elders for judgment.    You interceded and beat the man into unconsciousness and then, in a moment of inspiration, you cut off his left nipple.  The town elders arrived too late to stop you, but just in time to witness the nipplotomy.  They dragged chairs into the street and with the townspeople gathering around they proceeded to immediately judge the matter.  It did not take them long to judge that your actions required punishment.  Owing to the considerable service that you had provided the community over the previous year, the elders decided that your punishment would be lightened.  Your punishment would be to have both right and left nipples removed followed by a period of indentured servitude to the man that you had assaulted.  You glared back at the elders and at the townspeople.  You gave a stirring speech regarding the inequities within the community that you had witnessed.  At the end of the speech you stated that you did not accept the council's decree and instead declared your own judgment upon the community.  You declared that you would be the unseen protector of all women within the community from now until the end of time and that you would return to pass judgment on any man who so openly abused the women of the community.  With your closing words you threw the still bloody nipple onto the ground at the feet of the town elders.    The townspeople and elders looked around nervously.  With their eyes they pleaded with the fighting aged men of the community to do something with this woman who defied them.  But all of the fighting aged men of the community were they same men that you had patrolled with endlessly over the last year and it turns out they were more loyal to you than they were to the town elders.  You pushed your way through the crowd of townspeople, gathered your meager belongings, and left the town.    For a month you camped far from town and avoided all of the patrols.  At the end of the month you returned to town in the middle of the night.  You selected the home of one of the men from the village who was known for treating his wife and daughters poorly.  You snuck into his home, gagged him, and cut off his left nipple.  Not having been in town for the last month you did not know if he had abused his wife or daughters, but you knew it would be reasonable that everyone in town would believe that he had.  You knew this act would create terror in the minds of the men in town who would believe that you truly must be watching over the town and exacting vengeance as you saw fit.   Despite the fact that you no longer remembered your past, these actions felt right to you.  Moreover, in recent months prior to the altercation in the streets, you had become aware of a spiritual presence in your life that not only guided you, but aided you with the supplement of some simple cantrips and other abilities.  The exact nature and identity of your deity remained as much of a mystery to you as your memories, but it is clear to you that your relationship with this higher power was longstanding.  Though your curiosity remains intact, you have also decided to give into your instincts which guide you through your daily devotions.    Your instincts provide you with something else.  While you cannot remember into your past, you possess an inward sense of foreboding regarding who you are, what you are, and your fate to come.  After leaving Everdale you decide it is time to search Middle Earth for the clues that will connect you with your past and your destiny.    During your extensive travels you appear to have the unconscious habit of encountering groups who are obsessed with prophesies.  These groups are generally very isolated and are cultist in nature; regarding the prophecy itself as a thing to worship.  The Taarakian Promise, Philmore’s Prophecy, The Quaranian Codices, The Prophesies of Eiselfane are just a few of the bizarre prophesies that you have encountered.    The Taarakian Promise was a fanatically held belief by a small city in the mountains that their city was protected by a single warrior called The Taarakian.  You never saw any evidence of this warrior, but the city did appear to have survived the preceding Age of Chaos unscathed so perhaps there was something to it.    Philmore’s Prophecy was kept by a small band of humans hidden away in a mountain valley who believed that a Savior would one day return to “undo what had been done”.  A blind sculptor was at work carving The Savior into stone on the side of a mountain, presumably by divine inspiration.  It did not yet possess any recognizable features when you last saw it several hundred years ago as most of the work accomplished by that time was clearing the surrounding land and preparing the rock surface.  They people of the valley believed they were cursed and that The Savior would lift the curse from the valley.  Many strange events occurred while you visited the valley and you did not doubt that there appeared to be some curse upon these people.  However, you did not see how you could help them and eventually you wished them luck and travelled out of the valley.    The Quaranian Codices dealt with a series of manuscripts that described how The Lost God would either be freed from her underground prison, or would have her soul destroyed forever depending upon the exact sequencing of events during a prescribed ritual.  The Quaranian Codices also described where the Lost God would be found.  Humans and Gnomes worked side by side exploring a vast network of underground caverns in search of the Lost God and you spent many weeks in those caverns as well assisting them before you determined that it was time to move on.   The Prophecies of Eiselfane are a series of seemingly unrelated and bizarre rantings of an insane Beholder who the men of Trillingham discovered and captured in the forests near their village.  Completely overcome by insanity, the Beholder was incapable of mounting any resistance and was easily captured by the humans who brought it back to Trillingham as a totem or as “counting coup”.  Eventually the villagers began to believe that the Beholder which they had named Eiselfane possessed prophetic powers and began to record his bizarre rantings.    These recollections are merely the most interesting of encounters with prophesy mad Demihumans as you recall encountering many more than described above.  You never stayed in these communities long and it is difficult to recall specific details regarding the many groups and prophecies you encountered.  Throughout the hundreds of years that you have travelled Middle Earth you have found scant clues to your past.  Your only lead seems to be that your identity is occasionally mistaken for a man who shares similar features and temperament to yours.  His trail has led you to a small town in the north called New Breverik.  This man has not been seen in New Breverik, but the trail of sightings that you have followed indicate that he may be in this region.  You have decided to base yourself out of New Breverik while you wait for word from the many contacts you have developed in surrounding communities.  While waiting to hear word, you have had some friendly banter with a group of budding adventurers who have gathered in New Breverik.  You have always had trouble relating to normal humans and other demihumans who do not possess the mentality of a fighter.  You find that there is a certain purity and purpose in patrolling uncivilized lands, meeting the monstrous, passing judgment, and delivering justice all in one short episode and that only fellow fighters can truly understand this purity and purpose.  One other curious detail likely connects you to your past. From 33 June through 3 July each year and when bathed in the full moon as always appears on those dates, you can make out the faint traces of a strange symbol that appears on the palm of your dominant hand.  While you are an open book about much of the past that you remember, something tells you that this symbol is deeply personal and private.  You have not shared its existence with anyone. "}]}

He’s a child of wealth, ignorant of his privilege, which makes him    Background: Scholar’s Apprentice As the apprentice and assistant of a dedicated scholar, Torvald has spent years painstakingly copying ancient manuscripts and translating tales written in dead languages, sorting out forgeries from real antiques, and piecing together stories by weaving together disparate fragments found across many documents. He is at home in a library, surrounded by books. He loves learning new things and sharing what he learns, and has a knack for remembering odd bits of information. Sometimes it’s even useful.  Skill proficiencies: History, Investigation Feature: Possibly Relevant Information Torvald has read many, many books. There’s a very good chance that he’s run across something like whatever he’s dealing with in one of them. It might even be true!   Backstory As a child, Torvald intended to follow in his father’s footsteps as a brewmaster, but found his calling in the worship of Thor as a warrior priest. For the past 15 years, Torvald has served Halfdan son of Hallbjorn son of Halvor, of the Runeaxe clan, a senior cleric of Thor, first as an apprentice and then as an assistant. Halfdan is an exacting master, but Torvald has thrived under his tutelage, learning to fight and to work through Thor’s grace in the casting of spells.   Torvald’s master, Halfdan Runeaxe Halfdan was known in his younger days as a skilled warrior and cleric. As he has aged, he has become obsessed with the collection and study of writings from past ages. At times he seems possessed going days ignoring all things but his various collections of writings; reading, compiling notes, and dispatching letters across all of Middle Earth in search of more. He is regarded highly for his knowledge and is often sought out for his expertise in ancient scripts and the information they contain.   Two years ago, Halfdan was asked to represent Hammerheim on New Breverik’s Vigilance Committee, the counterpart to Hammerheim’s War Council, a position of great honor and prestige. Together, the Vigilance Committee and the War Council oversee the defense and peacekeeping efforts throughout the valley, organizing patrols, staffing and maintaining defensive works and sentry posts.   Halfdan has taken up residence in New Breverik in a small but sturdily constructed and comfortable house in the Noble’s Quarter of New Breverik, near to the Temple of Thor, where he and Torvald assist in services with the high priest, Olaf Doomhammer, a second cousin (once removed) of Torvald.   Hammerheim It is the year 6133. Torvald was born in the year 6078 in the glorious Dwarven citadel of Hammerheim. He is of the Doomhammer clan, which has ruled Hammerheim since its founding by Bartel Doomhammer in 2276 CR during the Third Age of Chaos, almost 4000 years ago. The sappers and warriors of Hammerheim played a key role in Third Ragnarok, tunneling underneath the Goblin fortress of Urthag and rising from its depths to slay the Underking Gothmog and deprive Sauron of key allies. In the Fourth Age of Men, Hammerheim gained fame for its fine beers, due in part to the citadel’s long relationship with the Humans of Breverik, who supplied hops and barley. Today, in addition to the Doomhammer clan, Hammerheim is home to the Runeaxe, Stonebreaker, Steeldriver, Deepminer and Goblinslayer clans. Dwarves of the Stonebreaker, Steeldriver and Deepminer clans are most often builders, smiths and miners, while the Runeaxe and Goblinslayer clans provide warriors.   During the Fourth Age of Chaos, with the valley overrun by monsters and fiends, the Humans of Breverik were encircled with no chance for escape or retreat and faced certain death. The Dwarves of Hammerheim worked quickly to save the Humans, carving tunnels from their citadel underneath the town. Then the Dwarves marched from Hammerheim toward the western flank of the forces of chaos, creating a diversion which allowed the Humans of Breverik to escape into the tunnels and to the citadel.  The Humans of Breverik spent the entire Fourth Age of Chaos in Hammerheim. At first the Humans were regarded by many Dwarves as interlopers and freeloaders; however, the Humans proved to be capable fighters and loyal allies and soon won over the stony hearts of their dwarven hosts. After nearly 2000 years of shared isolation within the citadel, there was not a single element of dwarf and human culture that was not shared. They spoke each other’s languages, shared gods and values, and took each other as apprentices to train in artisanship.   New Breverik In the year 5785, with the dawning of the Fourth Age of Man, many Humans and quite a few Dwarves left Hammerheim to return to the valley, founding New Breverik just across the river from the ruins of Breverik. The Heimers and the Brekkers, as the two groups call one another, are close, and while they are fond of teasing each other regarding their cultural idiosyncrasies, they quickly unite against outsiders who show disrespect for either culture.   As a sign of continuing gratitude, the Humans of New Breverik throw a feast after the fall harvest each year for the Dwarves of Hammerheim. At the third annual feast, the Dwarves reciprocated by bringing gifts from their artisans for the New Breverik Humans. It is an annual event that both Humans and Dwarves look forward to and has become known as Thanksgiving.   Today, as in the past, the Humans in the valley provide two valuable services for the Dwarven citadel. New Breverik’s position on the river makes it an excellent trading post, where the wares created by Dwarven artisans are shipped and sold throughout the surrounding lands. In addition, the city and the fertile farms of the valley provide a steady source of food, including the golden hops and barley that make Hammerheim’s famous beers so well-regarded.  "}]}

Vaniion was born in the year 6101 in the royal halls of the Silvan Kingdom of Mirkwood.  Vaniion is a direct descendant of Oropher, Thranduil, and Legolas.  The wood elves of Mirkwood are held in high regard throughout Middle Earth for their role in defeating Sauron at the end of the Third Age of Mankind.  Vaniion is the son of the Silvan King, Belwarthien, and Queen, Siohnen.  The Queen passed in the year 6128.  The Funeral was well attended by all the leadership of Middle Earth.  While she was a beloved Queen, it did not stifle the closely held rumors among those nearest the crown who whispered that Belwarthien was not the father of Vaniion.  Discrete and noble, the Elves of Mirkwood never discussed their suspicions in the direct presence of Vaniion, yet he is aware of the rumors.   Vaniion has one older brother and a younger brother and sister.  The older brother disappeared under mysterious circumstances.  The younger siblings are twins.   Lyestan is the eldest of the four siblings.  Born in the year 6097 He went missing from the kingdom in the year 6105 with his Akh Mathor.  An Akh Mathor is an Elf that is assigned to both protect and guide children of royal birth until they reach an appropriate age, generally considered around 50.  The Silvan Elves searched Mirkwood for close to 2 years without uncovering a single clue regarding Lyestan’s fate, which seemed as odd to the King and Queen as his disappearance.  Both the King and the Queen, despite the mysteriousness of Lyestan’s disappearance, have never given up hope that he will one day return.  At every meal a place setting is set in wait of Lyestan’s return.      While Vaniion does not have many memories of his older brother, the ones he retains are strong.  In these memories Vaniion remembers Lyestan as a loving older brother who included Vaniion on all of his childhood adventures.  Vaniion was heartbroken when his brother disappeared.    Lierin is Vaniion’s younger sister and his favorite sibling.  Bercareth is her twin brother.  As twins they are very close to one another and do everything as a team.  Lierin and Bercareth were born in the year 6115.  Lierin is arranged to be married to the heir apparent of the Lothlórien Kingdom in the year 6215 after they both have achieved an appropriate age and the opportunity to know each other.  Lierin finds the Lothlórien Elves a bit vain and proud and she has not yet noted any endearing qualities in her betrothed, but she admits that she is young and that there is time.  She will depart Mirkwood in 6135 to spend a few decades with the Lothlórien Elves.  Both the Lothlórien and Mirkwood Elves are looking forward to the wedding and the promise for better relations between the two Kingdoms that it portends.  Bercareth admits that he will be devastated when Lierin leaves the Kingdom.  Yaladasnin is Vaniion’s Akh Mathor and has been his constant companion since birth.  Yaladasnin has been present for every major event in Vaniion’s life.  Yaladasnin taught Vaniion his first letters and how to wield his first sword and fire his first arrow.  There is an intrinsic trust between the two.  At the age of 22, Vaniion was placed in charge of one of the kingdom’s patrols.  Vaniion loved patrolling Mirkwood and the surrounding lands and mountains.  He was a natural leader and his men and women of his patrol loved him.   In the year 6130, Belwarthien left the Kingdom of Mirkwood for Valinor in search of clues related to The Mercenary’s Creed, a prophesy that he had become obsessed with.  In Vaniion’s youth his teachers and his Akh Mathor taught him many prophesies.  The Pylotic Prophesy, The Mrin Codex, The Mercenary’s Creed, and the Prophesy of the Lost Gods are just a few that he learned.  Belwarthien always stressed the importance of knowing prophesy and Vaniion knows many older Elves who regard certain prophecies very highly so it was not a complete shock to you when your father decided to depart on a journey in search of prophetic meaning.  Vaniion remembers bits and pieces of prophecy, but put most of that learning behind him after he started patrolling.  Vaniion knows that only the rich and royalty spend any serious time studying prophecies.  With only 32 years of experience behind him, Vaniion was placed in charge of the kingdom with his Akh Mathor assigned as ghost regent.  Running the kingdom was never Vaniion’s aspiration and he did not enjoy it.  He was much more at home searching the Mirkwood or the neighboring mountains or plains.    After two years of enduring the privation and misfortune associated with ruling, and secretly plagued by thoughts that his rule might be considered illegitimate, Vaniion gathered his younger siblings and told them he was leaving the kingdom.  Lierin and Bercareth argued that this was not allowed as  Lierin had obligations to Lothlórien and Bercareth was considered too young, even with his Akh Mathor as ghost regent, to rule the Kingdom.  Vaniion, they argued, could not avoid his responsibilities.  Young and impulsive, Vaniion in company with his Akh Mathor left the Kingdom in secret shortly thereafter.      Knowing that his siblings will search for him and that they will send word throughout the known kingdoms, Vaniion dropped his family name and travels under the name of Anlyth.  Vaniion avoids discussing his past.  Yaladasnin although not completely behind Vaniion’s decision to leave the kingdom, cannot act in any other fashion than to support Vaniion’s chosen path and he has taken the name of Ayas while living outside the kingdom.  After a year of constant travel Vaniion (Anlyth) finds himself on the outskirts of civilization in the town of New Breverik.  He and Yaladasnin (Ayas) decide that a short rest is in order before moving onward. "}]}

Lars Greentree was born in the year 6095 to Elgalin Greentree and Theran Greentree.  Elgalin, your mother was a Half-Elf and Theran, your father was an Elf.  Both Mom and Dad were distantly related to the Wood Elves of Mirkwood, but are descended from a long line of adventurers who left the Kingdom of Mirkwood early on during the Fourth Age of Chaos.    Both Elgalin  and Theran  were children born near the transition between the Fourth age of Chaos and the Fourth Age of Mankind and were more comfortable living a life of uncertainty that was common during the time of their births than they were in the confines of civilization.  Elgalin and Theran, in keeping with their recent ancestry, were adventurers in a small but modestly successful adventuring party.   In the year 6105, Elgalin and Theran Greentree departed with an adventuring group to the ruins of Imrryr, once known as The Dreaming City.  It was a campaign that had been years in the planning as the dangers of Dragon Isle were well documented.  While the risks were high, the rewards promised to be equally so; the adventuring party had been to the outskirts of Dragon Isle several times and had never been disappointed.  The adventuring party never returned.    While he has fond memories of both parents, Lars remembers his mother the best as she was sometimes left behind while his father adventured to support the family.  Elgalin was a caring mother and a good teacher.  In their home on the outskirts of the port city of Bergen she taught him the languages of the Dwarves, Gnomes, and Halflings which she learned in her youth along with the language of Orcs and the peculiar dialect of the Drow which she learned during her adventuring years.  She was also fond of regaling Lars with tales of adventuring.  On the eve of their departure for the ruins of Imrryr, Elgalin  and Theran travelled into Bergen and left Lars with Svavar Gardarson, a human and distant cousin on Elgalin’s side of the family.  Svavar was more than just a distant relation, he was also a close family friend who had helped Elgalin  and Theran on numerous occasions.  Lars’ last memory of his mother was her attaching an amulet around his neck and making him promise that he would never remove it.  Elgalin claimed that it was magical and would help protect him while she and Theran were away.  She warned him that the amulet would now be specially linked with Lars, but that the link would be broken and it’s magic would fail if the amulet was ever removed.  Lars has never removed the amulet.  At times Lars wonders if his mother had kept the amulet for herself then maybe she would have survived.        At first, Svavar acted as Lars’s protector and continued his education and raised him as he felt that Elgalin  and Theran would have desired.  However, as the years wore on and it became apparent that Elgalin  and Theran would never return, Svavar began to treat Lars as his own son and raised him in that fashion.    It was not long thereafter that Svavar took Lars into his confidence and showed him a whole new world.  Svavar is the head of a vast network of thieves and assassins throughout all of Middle Earth called “The Organization”.  Not every thief and assassin in Middle Earth belongs to the organization, but many do.  Those that do not belong to The Organization typically deal in small petty crime and are seldom organized in anything larger than a street gang.  Thieves and assassins who aspire to greater crimes or who become organized at a higher level are generally approached by The Organization and made an offer that they cannot refuse.  The Organization exists on two levels.  The outer ring is a network of smuggling, extortion, and similar higher level crimes which require a level of sophistication and organization beyond that of a mere street gang.  Those that belong to the outer ring work on the shadowy fringes of society and, while the existence of The Organization is difficult to conceal in entirety, they nevertheless go through great pains to eliminate all evidence that points definitively to its existence.  Thieves and assassins take blood oaths and frequently risk themselves personally in order to maintain the secrets of The Organization.  Despite these efforts and despite the lack of any direct evidence to its existence, rumors of The Organization and its alleged activities are common throughout Middle Earth.  The inner ring of The Organization is a group within the group.  The inner ring does not deal in the affairs of organized crime for profit.  The work of the inner ring is that of statecraft; corrupting bureaucracies, stealing state secrets, blackmail and extortion at the state level, kidnappings of high officials, and assassinations of those who are supposed to be impossible to assassinate.  The inner ring works to obtain political power and leverage in order to advance the interests of The Organization.  While operatives in the outer ring sometimes act unknowingly to carry out the interests of the inner ring, only those thieves and assassins that are part of the inner ring know of its existence.       Svavar runs a legitimate shipping company in Bergen which allows him to launder money and also provides him the necessary excuses when he finds it necessary to travel on behalf of The Organization.  Most of his employees have no idea that they are working as part of a front for The Organization.  At the same time that Svavar was apprenticing Lars through The Organization, he was also apprenticing Lars through his legitimate shipping company in order to provide Lars with an adequate cover for his travels and entanglements.  Lars has worked as a longshoreman, foreman, dock supervisor, and warehouse manager.    While the initial years when the exact nature of their relationship was being forged were difficult for both Lars and Svavar, Svavar has proven to be a worthy adoptive father to Lars and it is plain to both those inside and outside The Organization that he cares for Lars deeply.  Svavar his striven to provide Lars with every advantage.  Svavar was widowed before taking Lars in and has never bothered to remarry.  Without any other children to his name and fast approaching the age of 80, he has made it clear to both the outer and inner rings that Lars will be his successor.    Lars, for his part, is well respected both within and without The Organization for his shrewdness and is seen as a worthy heir to both the legitimate and illegitimate dealings of his adopted father.  Svavar does not see his activities as strictly criminal.  He understands that often times the activities that he is involved in are against the local laws or customs, but he is worldly enough to understand that the laws of mankind are often short sighted or poorly constructed and can vary greatly from region to region.    Svavar sees himself as an entrepreneur who is capitalizing on events and situations that would be capitalized upon by others if it were not for the simple fact that he was the first to act upon the opportunity.  Through his lens, Svavar neither sees his actions as good or as evil, he sees them simply as necessary.  Based upon this viewpoint, Svavar has a rather utilitarian philosophy to his organization’s activities.  Svavar does not act out of malice and is not willing to commit acts that will do great harm to others if they will only provide some limited good to The Organization.  He prefers what are generally considered as victimless crimes, although he is not opposed to doing harm to others when the amount of harm inflicted is considered small and the amount of gain that The Organization will receive is large.   As Svavar has aged he has become more and more obsessed with a prophecy that was delivered to a distant ancestor and head of The Organization.  Lars never bothered much with prophecies as he was too concerned with the important business of the here and now to worry over such insubstantialities as prophecies suggest.  However, Lars could not fully avoid Svavar’s obsession and was at least aware that this particular prophecy was delivered by the Oracle of Pylos and that it described a time and circumstance when the “Kingdom within Kingdoms” would rule and guide Middle Earth through an age of chaos.  The Pylotic Prophecy is considered private family business and Lars is unaware of anyone beyond Svarvar who may have knowledge of its existence.     Svavar has confided in Lars that he believes that events are on the rise that will provide greater illumination regarding the Pylotic Prophecy and has directed Lars to proceed to the town of Breverik where you are to make contact with Fordin, an operative in the outer ring who acts as The Organization's eyes and ears in that region.  While Fordin is ignorant of the inner ring and the Pylotic Prophesy, he has delivered reports to Svavar that lead Svavar to believe that events are occurring in that region that were foretold in the prophecy.  Svavar believes these events are connected to the Temple of Thor and has directed Lars, his most trusted operative, to proceed to Breverik and to do his best to monitor the region and the temple along with Fordin.    Just prior to Lars’ departure, Svavar was a bit emotional regarding Lars leaving.  In an exceptionally warm and tender moment while Svavar was personally outfitting Lars for his journey, Svavar shared with him the following sentiment.  “In the past I have shielded you from certain truths regarding my past.  It is unlikely as you go out into the world that I will be able to continue to shield you from these truths.  I would share these truths with you now if I knew a path to do so.  But I do not.  Please know, Lars, that whatever you may learn about me regarding my past that it changes nothing with respect to us.  I have and will always love you like a son.”  Lars thought this was an odd thing for Svavar to say as there was nothing imaginable to Lars that would change the way he feels toward his adopted father.  Lars chalked it up to simple nerves and provided Svavar the typical reassurances that such a situation would warrant.   Lars backstory for the good people of Breverik is that he has a desire to follow in the footsteps of his late mother and father and to try his skills at adventuring. "}]}

Their family's shipping fleet once boasted a hundred ships who made berth in the harbors of the capital when they weren't transporting goods between the nation's many islands.  The wealth they earned from this business bought the Ashlanders nobility and renown, and for generations they wanted for nothing.    Over time, however, as the political climate of the islands grew more severe, their business began to wane.  The Ashlanders refused to employ slave labor or slash the modest wages of their crews.  Inevitably, other traders unconcerned with taking on such practices made much greater profits, and attracted the patronage of those who shared their views on how the common people should be treated.    By the time Devona and Senra were born, the nobility of their blood existed in name alone.  The sisters spent many of their childhood hours playing within the vacant, cobwebbed corridors of the once opulent Ashlander manor.  Day by day, the borders within which they were allowed to roam grew ever smaller as more rooms and halls crumbled into dangerous disrepair.  Eventually, the abandoned wings of the house grew too unsafe to continue exploring, and the sisters grew old enough to adopt more intricate hobbies - Devona taking up violin, which her sister accompanied with dancing.  The two remained one another's sole source of companionship... at least until the day that Senra's acrobatic skills caught the interest of a wealthy benefactor from outside the Capital, who offered to enroll her in a private academy where she could further hone the art of her performance free of charge.    The last time the twins saw eachother they were eight years old.  Devona would have been lying to say that she wasn't somewhat jealous - why were Senra's talents so much more impressive than her own? - but mostly she just missed her sister.  She spent much of the lonely years that followed perfecting her musical abilities and listening to her grandparents' stories.  The tales they told were of Ashlander manor during its days of glittering grandeur... of Mol'Darin before tyranny spoiled it... of their own youths spent out on the sea.  Three weeks after the marking of Devona's thirteenth year her grandmother succumbed to a wasting illness she'd been battling with for some time.  Four months later, her brokenhearted grandfather followed her to the grave... and before the years' close, the letter arrived - a terrible accident, no body to bury, Senra - dead.  A part of Devona never believed it - a twin just knew... but her parents put little stock in that superstition.  They mourned, they interred an empty casket in the family mausoleum next to those of their own parents, and the manorhouse grew silent.    But Devona had been inspired - both by the glimpses her grandparents' tales had given her to the life of splendor their family once enjoyed - and the power which the very words they'd spoken held... and by the mysterious fate of her twin sister.  Devona realized she didn't even know where the school Senra had been taken to was located... but she knew she would not find out - or find Senra - if she merely idled in their wasting mansion.  It took little effort for Devona to convince her parents to allow her to accompany them on their voyages at sea.  Though her parents doubted their business would last to see their child take command of it, they were still eager to keep their daughter close by.  Initially Devona merely observed while they bartered and traded, but she was always eager to deepen her involvement, and soon proved to possess a natural charm and way with words.  She picked up the skills of shiphandling quickly, and used her free time during the long voyages to continue to practice her music, and, on occasion, entertain and inspire the crew with the same stories she'd grown up with.    Over the next seven years she made no progress toward the goal of discovering her sister's whereabouts, especially given that her attempts to seek information about this mysterious school and the man who ran it had to be done in secrecy so as not to upset her parents.  Instead, she made many friends among the sailors who'd remained loyal to her family.  She learned their songs, and acquainted herself with the ways of the common people from which she'd lived most her life in seperation.  It was during this period that she met and grew close to fellow Tiefling and captain in the Ashlanders' fleet Fatua Chaylum, coming to view her as a role model to look up to, and even a surrogate family member, especially after the loss of so many others.    When Devona was 20, the ship she and her parents were sailing on went down in a storm.  She washed up on a small island nearby, but there was no sign of her parents, the ship, or its crew.  It took her some time to recover from the incident, and longer still to make her way back to the capital.  When she arrived, she found that her home and her family's belongings had been seized by the nobles who had once been her neighbors.  Devona was furious and desperate to take back what was hers, but Fatua intervened.  Now that there were no Ashlanders left to ask questions, she was sure that Devona's claim on the property would prove no great obstacle to anyone currently helping themselves to her birthright.  With Fatua, and a handful of other sailors behind her, Devona boarded her family's private vessel - The Midnight Star, a small pleasure craft unsuitable for carrying full shipments of goods - and sailed it out of its hidden mooring beneath Ashlander manor under cover of darkness.  Watching the lights of the great city sink into the sea behind, she vowed to restore her family’s wealth and honor by whatever means necessary.    Devona spent the next several years freelancing, taking any job that paid enough to profit - chauffeuring diplomats between cities, working as a courier for smaller loads of goods, even smuggling, and 'intercepting' other shipments if contracted to do so at a high enough price.  Not wanting to tarnish her family's name with the more sordid affairs she engaged in, Devona continued all further oceanborn adventuring under the alias of 'Captain Ash', though in situations where a different approach would be more advantageous, she sheds this persona and presents herself as the mild-mannered 'Lady Devona' instead.  She still searches for her sister... but with nearly two decades gone since last they met, her hope is running thin."}]}

This character is a goblin monk."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Wakachaka's story begins with her swarm as they were raiding a country town - a normal activity for them to do on slow Sunday nights. After slaying the last peasant, they retired to the local tavern to revel in their looting. As the celebration wore on, Wakachaka got up on a table and started taking bets on how much ale she could drink and still remain standing.  ?Wakachaka doesn't remember whether she won any bets, but she assumes that she did not... She awoke the next day (maybe?) under a collapsed bed in a back room. It was a trick getting out, and once she did she found the tavern, and the whole town, abandoned. Apparently, buried under shards of wood and chunky blankets, the swarm had given up trying to find her, left her behind, and moved on... or perhaps they'd just been too hung over to realize she was even missing.  ?Having never been very good with directions, rather than try to find her way back, Wakachaka decided to make this town her new home. It certainly smelled better than the old den anyway, at least once she got done burning the bodies. The pantries were well-stocked and the tavern was still full of ale, and for two weeks Wakachaka lived in greater luxury than most gerblins ever know... until the visitors came...   ?Luckily, it was an openminded band of adventurers (or at least not especially intelligent ones) who first arrived at her door. They thought nothing of the empty town, the wrecked tavern, or the fact that it had a gerblin for a barkeep. Wakachaka, dumbfounded by their sudden arrival, was halfway through pondering how best to slit their throats and take their coin when they just... gave it to her... in exchange for rooms and drinks.   ?The next day the adventurers moved on... but they were back within the week, spending freely from the spoils of their expedition. In fact, they were so charmed by Wakachaka's somewhat vicious brand of hospitality that they promised to make her tavern a regular stop in their travels. By their next arrival Wakachaka had even managed to sweep up a bit.  ?This continued for a time, and before long other travelers began to filter in, brought by chance or by word of mouth from others who had sung her praises. Before she knew it, Wakachaka had a bustling business - which she named The Broken Bunk after the intoxicated accident that had ultimately led to her inheriting it. Even the empty village surrounding it was starting to attract new settlers to its conveniently vacant housing. Evidently assuming that she was the landlord, farmers and merchants started buying the land from Wakachaka and making themselves at home.  ?By this time, however, the ale supply was running dangerously low... but Wakachaka wasn't worried. Down in the caverns of her old den she'd been quite the accomplished poisonmaker, and she was certain she could apply those same skills to brewing.   ?It took... a few attempts... and a few houses winding up mysteriously empty again when her patrons sampled from those early failed batches, but Wakachaka eventually found a method that worked, and the ale flowed freely from her tavern once more. For years to follow, Wakachaka diligently perfected her craft and expanded her menu. Her brews won awards and even gained her membership in the kingdom's renowned brewer's guild. Wakachaka became so elated with her string of successes that she began celebrating them with the same raucous fervor that she had the original raid on the town.  ?After one incident during which she all but emptied her whole stock herself, Wakachaka fell into an drunken stupor so deep that she slept three straight days, and during that extended unconsciousness, she received a revelation... Wakachaka woke up to find she'd been bestowed secret knowledge and power straight from the drink itself. The next day, without a word of warning to her customers, her employees, or her many taxpayers, she packed away her brewing equipment, emptied the remaining kegs in her storeroom, locked up the Broken Bunk, and disappeared.  ?Since then, Wakachaka has lived on the road, taking up a life of adventure like those first guests to come to her humble inn. She wanders the world in pursuit of a most profound quest - to assemble the perfect combination of ingredients needed to brew a beverage of the most sublime taste and highest potency... at which point, for her noble efforts, Wakachaka believes she will ascend to achieve a higher state of being. Along the way she intends to seek out and sample all manner of alchohols of exotic origin to help further hone her palatte for this monumental task. "}]}

Slave of house Arvu, probably originally from some rural tribe or another that one of the merchant caravans happened across. I'm thinking Grandwater took him, and then sold him off to Arvu when they got back to Khemi. Probably one of his parents sold him off, maybe because being a half-breed was shameful to them, but if it works better that he was just taken that's a good hook too.  Quickly learned that words and subtle action had more power than violence. He was probably a bit of a bully at first, until someone taught him that lesson. Fast forward a ten-year or so and he's talked his way in the the personal service of one of Leopold Arvu's wives. Would put on shows, tell stories, go out and steal small trinkets for her, etc. I imagine it's not uncommon for both male and female high ranking merchants to keep consorts, but when Leopold found out about it (being a jealous type) he gave Cal over to the researchers of house Arvu who were looking to improve upon the design of their glyph of protection. Unfortunately this process has many trials and errors along the way... and Leopold was counting on an error. Cal was given a modified Glyph (mechanically maybe no protection as it was a total failure, or maybe just on par with a normal glyph at lvl 1 protection) and subjected to a Demon... who possessed him. In true quick talking Huckster fashion though, he struck a deal for their lives (they would kill him and the demon both after all). Leave Cal in control for now, lend him some power, and he would get them out.  This process took place in a remote research facility of the Arvu, in a village secretly under their control. The place had a very Area 51 vibe in the cultural lore of the area, with more than the normal rumors circulating, sightings of monsters, villagers gone missing in the night, etc. The whole village is run through with a network of underground tunnels, and there are lots houses with fake doors and no occupants, used as fronts for the research labs and having their only points of ingress and egress as these tunnels. They had more food and fine inks being imported than the populace could possibly use (secretly needed for the researchers and slaves). Cal survived his ordeal, appearing not to have been possessed, and was kept on as a slave for further study and, he suspected, eventual dissection at Leopold’s request. So, Cal and the Devil set a plan into motion, leaking little tidbits to the villagers of the sizeable shipments being snuck in to the facilities at night. One evening raiders attacked the village, responding to the rumors of great wealth flooding in, and Cal took his chance. In a gambit he hoped would look to his masters like he was trying to protect their interests, he approached the raiders alone. He was feeling confident that he could talk his way into their good graces and in so doing make his escape… but he miscalculated. He was beaten within an inch of his life, tied in to a sack, and thrown into river. By a true stroke of luck, a war-tattered man (Chris’ character) saw this turn of events and plucked him from his watery grave. Mr. Noname brought Cal back to health over the coming weeks, but then snuck off with nary a word. A strange turn of events, to be so indebted to a stranger and have them ask for nothing in return. At least now the Arvu would take him for dead…. If he could just find a way to remove the slave mark he might be able to keep them in the dark for a while longer... "}]}

Her family had been protectors of a death god referred to as the Unknown for generations. She was expected to continue this family journey as well. Spreading the word of the Unknown, and living by it’s rules. As the second child in her family, her brother was to take his place as the head of the temple once their mother chose to step down, while N’talhi was allowed to travel more freely. The local lord of their city, Lord Cavannaugh, was a very religious man and encouraged his family to regularly attend worship on the holy days of the Unknown. His youngest daughter, Kalina, was often in attendance. Kalina and N’talhi soon became fast friends, and then infatuated with each other. Together they schemed up a political pact that would ensure they could live together without any “family duties” preventing them from being together. They proposed a “political marriage” that really had little to do with politics and more to do with love. Their parents allowed this, and chose to view it as a political union between the heads of state and the head of religion in their region. One day, Kalina had been acting strangely, and had stopped attending worship at the temple of the Unknown. After about a week N’talhi, being of a stubborn sort, tracked her down and realized that not all was what it seemed. Through her connection with the unknown it became clear that Kalina had been killed, her corpse reanimated, and was being used by mecromancers to disrupt the political situation. In tears she struck down the creature that was once her fiancée, and carefully brought her body to the temple. Once the body had been slain a second time, it became clear that she had been dead for quite some time.

She offered up a deal to the Unknown- eradicate the sect of mecromancers spitting in the face of their religion, and she would be granted her love back. Whole and unharmed. The Unknown accepted, and N’talhi now roams throughout the world, searching for whispers of the black sect, and making sure that no others fall to the same fate as she. Now all she needs is a group of friends to help her carve out the undead."}]}

The majority of our interaction with the world beyond was via trading boats with the nearby city. I would spend hours with my best friend Kaolan looking at the strange wares that the traders brought. Otherwise we’d be playing in the trees when we were younger or causing mayhem in and around the taverns as we got older – we we’re practically inseparable.  One evening, after a few too many tankards of sour wine, Kaolan and I were huddled in the corner of the tavern listening to Bong-Eyed Balthezar the Untrustworthy (he’d never done anything to make him untrustworthy, there was just an old folk tale about being suspicious of people who don’t look straight at you when they’re talking to you) play a lute and sing of distant lands. I still only vaguely remember professing some level of love to be able to move a crowd as the music was moving me that night but the next morning Kaolan bought me my own lute from the trading boats and I couldn’t be happier! From then I spent countless evenings creating melodies and singing about the legends of our islands with Kaolan by my side, either helping with the lyrics or lamping anyone who got a bit too close and touchy-feely whilst I was performing (closer than I’d normally consider tolerable, that is). I couldn’t have been happier than I was those years.   And then Kaolan was gone.  His parents had important connections with the trading guild in the city and so he was sent away as part of an arranged marriage to secure a “financially beneficial future” they told me in a rather matter of fact way. Everything on the islands felt cold and unwelcoming. Even when the autumnal bonfires blazed high into the night sky and families would come together, laughing and joking, I felt lost. Turning to rotten mead and wine wouldn’t bring Kaolan back but it was certainly preferable to clarity. It was during an eve of drinking that Balthezar was weaving tales of travelling musicians – dwarves, halflings and the like who traveled the country, living a nomadic lifestyle with the their instruments, each other and nothing more.  Early the following morning, as the hangover wore off and I could see in colour again, I packed up my possessions, got onto one of the trading boats, left The Evermoors for the first time in my life and never looked back."}]}

No one. That is the answer. But how did all this come to be, you ask? Well whether you are asking or not, too bad, I’m going to tell you anyways. Our tale begins in the magical land of Aenora. Well… only sort-of magical. Obviously there are wizards and shite, but that is beside the point. 20 years ago to the day this tale was wrote, a young boy by the name of Memely Pepeartly. Not a day over the age of 5 he was, the skipper young lad. His mother, a Halfling Bardess locally known as “The Iron Maiden” for her sick luting skills, raised her son lovingly, teaching him the small things about music that he would eventually grow to love.  Upon the young halfing’s 5th birthday, his mother decidedly took him to a travelling fair, of sorts, complete with run magic, rides, and the many animals of the realm. The day couldn’t had been more perfect. The two were bonding as best a mother and her son could, and even a blind-man could see the love they had for each other. That all changed however, when one the pair decided to visit one of the animals on display to pet and play with. It all happened in a fun exhibit of the fair, for what could be considered the petting zoo of the event. Many sorts of small and exotic creatures were on display for the young ones to play with and pet. Nothing hostile or dangerous of the sort. Memely, curious of a rather large bird out on display with a large sign reading “Deep Goose”, cautiously walked forward to make friends with the animal. His mother, unaware what was going on, as she too, was interested at some of the cute animals, was unaware that her small, halfing child, holding his ice-cream happily in his hands, was venturing further and further into the exhibit in pursuit of the Goose. Eventually, far out of earshot of Memely’s mother, the Goose noticed the food that he had in his small hands. The Goose, concerned with nothing else but the food, attempted to take it from the small child, but only proceeded to pick up the boy entirely, and, scared at the mass now kicking and crying, proceeded to fly and jump over the crowds, over the fence enclosing the place, and, with Memely in tow, out into the woods, far away from his mother. Kicking and screaming, trying to get the Goose to release him, eventually, it let him go, and,  seeking its reward, plucked the treat from the halfing’s small hand, and leaving him there; alone and crying in the woods without a mother, and no signs of any onlookers or rescue. Days went by, as Memely waited for help, finding shelter in trees, and calling out to anyone who would be able to hear him, but to no avail. Each day, he wandered out a little bit further in the hopes of finding someone… anyone; but each day he unknowingly became just a little bit more lost. One day, the halfling happened upon a rather large lake uncharacteristically dominating the once forested landscape he had come to know the past weeks. Finding refuge in this new place, Memely sought shelter within a large, hollowed tree bordering the forest outside of the lake. It wasn’t until the next morning, upon waking up, that the small halfing realized that, even without blankets, or any means but his clothes to keep warm, he felt a friendly presence around him, and upon further inspection, found that he was surrounded by Ducks; many of them, all huddled around him and sleeping in a group. Perplexed that these birds had taken such a liking to him, he befriended them over the coming weeks, foraging for food, seeking shelter, and learning to swim.  Weeks went by, and the halfing, now considering the group of Ducks his family, felt considerably less sad at the prospect of losing his mother. Each day, he became more and more distant from the life he once had, and closer to the one he shared with his family of Ducks. Eventually, he donned the name “Ducky”, and this being part of his new identity, he slowly began forgetting about his previous one each day. It wasn’t until the age of 10 that things would interrupt the perfect life he lived with his family of Ducks. He had only just woken up one day, when the most peculiar noises started emanating from a far edge of the lake. It was mystifying to him; after years of hardly any other human, or humanoid, rather, contact of any form, there sat a group of fellow halfings. 3 or 4 of them, all playing a rather calming tune with, what looked like to Ducky, bowls with sticks on the end, with spanning strings down the length of the contraption. He had never heard anything like it. It was a wonderful freeing feeling to hear the notes and harmonies that sailed through the air.  Wanting to learn more about it all, and to get a better listen, he neared closer and closer to the halflings that would soon have a defining effect upon Ducky’s life. Upon further inspection of the group, they took notice of the small boy. It had been years since he had been missing, so unsurprisingly, he was not seen as the missing halfling boy from years prior. In fact, at first they simply laughed at the mannerisms of the child as he approached, dancing all the while, beaming all the while.  Setting up camp for the night, the group noticed that the strange child, who, they had figured out, spoke very little common or halfling, had not returned to a family of other halflings they had originally presumed were accompanying him around the lake, but rather took refuge in a large and empty tree. Upon further investigation, they realized that this child seemed to not have a mother or father at all. It was not until the next day that, before leaving, they offered to take Ducky along with them. With the little language that he had retained from childhood, he was able to understand their proposition, and was delighted at the prospect of being with others who looked like him, and others who he had found great enjoyment in the way they played their strange instruments. He told his family of ducks his farewells with the small gestures he had picked up as a child to communicate with them, and was off into the world with this strange band of strangers who had seemed to take a liking to him.  The group of travelling performers had quickly realized that Ducky had no family to call on. It had simply been too long, and the search had been long over, so adopting him into their group, they traveled together for many years. Fast-forward about 8, and in that time, Ducky had been taught how to speak fluently in the two languages he grew up with, being Halfling and Common, and learned how to play all sorts of instruments. Though he has very skilled at instruments like the pan-flute, and all sorts of drums, he always took a very particular liking to the Lute, especially.  As Ducky was 18 now, he felt profoundly inspired to get a greater education in the music he had come to love from his lively band of misfits, and wanting to do them proud, he went off to Bard College to become just that, a Bard!  During his time in Bard college, however, his adventures and discoveries were still in great supply. Ducky, who was keen with people and very apt to being in front of large crowds, had noticed that there was always a good number of people willing to make fun of drawings and picture, seemingly with sarcastic undertones about facts of life, or just jokes in general. He had always been able to steer awkward conversations into hilarious ones when he combined his jokes and conversation with relation to pictures or popular stories in the news. Wanting to know more about this phenomenon, he decidedly began studying up on social interaction of this kind alongside his studies as a bard. The school itself had not had a name for this type of study, so they allowed Ducky time to come up with a name for the minor education he had started.  Looking for inspiration on what to call it, he headed out into the woods to play some music in solace. It was there that he had met a being that would inspire him to be the Halfling he is today. There, cautiously looking up at him was a frog; one slightly larger than the average frog, but with very bulbous eyes, and a face that could display emotions of many types. He quickly broke out his sketch pad, and very artfully sketched out the creature, speaking to it all the while. It never spoke back, but it always seemed to understand, and stayed very still, sometimes smiling at the jokes Ducky had put forth. As soon as Ducky had finished the drawing, however, the frog had vanished; nowhere to be found. Looking back down at his drawing, a word, previously uninvented came to him that Ducky believed would describe very well, the study he was in. One that would define a generation many thousands of years  into the future… Memes. Ducky had just made the world’s first Meme, to which he named “Pepe”, out of impression that the mystical frog had given him.  And so, it was decided. Ducky, the little bard from the forest, was to be educated, and pave the way for studies in Memes. His teachers, all very perplexed, yet interested in his studies, found them to be quite insightful, seeing as the school itself was a school for the entertaining arts, and the study Ducky had invented was exactly that; an art for entertainment.  Around the age of 20, he graduated Bard College, ready and willing to put forth his magnificent music into the world, and to make the world happy alongside his invention of Memes. Ducky spent the last 5 years, coming up with new Meme ideas, as well as entertaining crowds all over the land of Aenora, and honing his skills as an adventurer alongside companions he has met through his travels; though none of them really stuck around for very long, as many of them were just out looking for work.  It was a rather welcome surprise then, when, upon taking up a job in a local tavern, Ducky had stumbled upon the very group of oddballs he would soon become great friends with; travelling the world, and going on his greatest adventure in life yet!"}]}

His mother (Glynda Roxan) had been a popular professor in the field of planar lore, and his father (Jameson Roxan) used to be an adventurer of some renown, as far as Erin knew. As he grew a bit older however, Erin could sense that there was something they weren’t telling him, as the relationship between his parents had become somewhat strained lately. Little did he know that he would get his answers soon enough, but not in the way he had wanted.   One night, a few days after his 19th birthday, Erin and his family were rudely awakened when a group of cultists invaded his home, and proceeded to trash the place. As they were attacked seemingly without cause, Erin tried to be brave by defending himself against one such cultist. Miraculously, Erin managed to disarm the attacker, knocking him unconscious with a shovel, before the young man was overpowered and beaten into submission by the others.   As the family of three was held captive in their own home, the leader of the attack revealed himself. A cruel-looking Tiefling with dark-blue skin, he greeted Jameson, revealing that they were very much acquainted with each other. Ignoring Jameson’s pleas to leave him out of this, the leader prepared to ritually sacrifice the young man, only to be thwarted by another surprise visitor. Two cultists suddenly dropped dead as crossbow bolts pierced through a window and went through their skulls. Seconds later, a mysterious stranger cane crashing through what was left of the window, giving Erin enough of a distraction to slip out of the cultists’ grasp. The stranger, a rugged middle-aged man with a ponytail and an eyepatch, proceeded to make quick work of the leader’s lackeys, his dual hand crossbows piercing their robes and flesh with deadly accuracy. With no-one else left, the leader cursed Jameson’s name in a demonic tongue, before teleporting away.   With the danger passed, the stranger revealed himself as Braig Zenedar, a human who was close friends with Jameson. And as this was revealed, Jameson now knew he had no choice but to tell his son the truth about him; a truth that Erin’s mother already knew. Erin learned that night that both Jameson and Braig were members of a semi-secret organization known as The Harpers, though Jameson had since retired from service in order to focus on raiding a family, hoping that Erin would grow up to have a more normal life. In the meantime, Braig had been tasked with secretly keeping an eye on the family, in case something happened to Jameson. Jameson and Glynda had been debating whether or not to tell Erin sooner, which was the cause of the marital strain from earlier.   Unfortunately, now that one of Jameson’s enemies knew where he was, all three of them would have to leave the farm behind, so that Braig could take them to a Harper-owned safehouse, within the city of Berdusk. As a Harper, Jameson has apparently made enemies of the Cult of Worms, a group that worshipped twisted aberrations from the Far Realm. Although saddened and upset by the news, Erin was very grateful to Braig for coming to their rescue when they did.   Along the way, Braig learned about how Erin had bravely tried to stand up to the cultists. So when the family was finally set up in the appointed safehouse, Erin was offered a choice: either stay with his parents, where he would be safe, or come to Twilight Hall with Braig, and begin training as an initiate of The Harpers. Although Jameson objected to some extent at this choice, he ultimately conceded that it was Erin’s choice. Wanting to find more answers about his father past as a Harper, and wanting to get back at the Cult for threatening his parents, Erin accepted Braig’s offer, and left with him to Twilight Hall.   After a year’s worth of gruelling mental and physical training, Erin eventually surpassed the expectations of his peers, becoming very proficient in the art of dual-wielding, cutting his teeth on the local goblin and kobold population. As Braig looked on with some amount of pride, having taken a liking to the kid, Erin was able to truly join the Harpers as a fully-fledged Watcher, ready and willing to take on his first real mission for the clandestine organization.

This would ultimately lead her to be passed down to the care of her criminal uncle, Kagaran the Spade. As a member of the Red Scarves Gang, Kagaran had to keep Jhuri's existence a secret from the other members because of Natalnya, tiefling leader of the gang, who had set down the rule that gang members were not permitted to have children, lest they become \"excess mouths to feed\". But out of respect for Jhuri's father, Karagan couldn't bring himself to get rid of her, and instead kept her secretly at his meager house in Crossroads City, teaching her calligraphy in order to help him forge documents for the gang. Eventually, he even told her what he knew about her father, mostly that he used to be a skilled adventurer, but allegedly perished in battle, leaving her mother to give birth alone.  This was all well and good for a shockingly long time, until Beezle, a kapak draconian member of the gang, spied Karagan and a 15-year-old Jhuri and put two and two together. The moment Natalnya found out, Karagan's former \"friends\" quickly turned on him, breaking into his home and murdering him in cold blood.

But just as it seemed that Jhuri's life would end, the killers were attacked by a monk from the local monastery, forcing them to flee. Seeing Jhuri in her profusely-bleeding state, the half-elven monk sought to stabilize her out of kindness, and began to carry her to the monastery as she passed out.  Days of recovery later, Jhuri's rescuer introduced himself as Vulkan, claiming to be a former friend of her father's, and extended an offer to train her in the martial arts, so that she would be able to better defend herself. Once she was well enough, Jhuri readily accepted, though primarily out of desire for vengeance. For the next four years, Jhuri became a worthwhile monk under Vulkan's tutelage, and quickly learned that anger would only deter her from reaching her potential. Although she would go on to complete her training, she would never fully rid herself of hit, instead burying her emotions under a cold and aloof exterior.  Knowing that the Red Scarves would never truly leave her alone, Jhuri eventually consciously left Vulkan's care, seeking to become an adventurer, and become strong enough to tear down the Scarves, and everything they stood for."}]}

Keep it short and concise."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The first true memory Kriv had upon his hatching was awakening inside the home of a female human thief.  At first, when he was still learning to walk, he didn't think much of it, believing that it was somehow normal. But as he starting maturing rapidly over the next few years, he quickly realized that he was too different from the human that had apparently taken him in, and started demanding answers. The thief, Rukia Kazume, tried her best to do so, understanding that she could no longer afford to keep it a secret.  Rukia had no idea who the dragonborn's real parents were, because she had found him as an egg, hidden in a section of the sewers she had been exploring in Brindol at the time. Feeling some amount of pity, she had decided to take it back with her, and try to take care of it as best as she could. \"Kriv\" had simply been the name SHE had given it. Although confused as to why his parents would ever abandon him, Kriv reluctantly accepted Rukia's story. Eventually, as Kriv continued to get older, decided that he wanted Rukia to teach him everything she knew about being a rogue, a request that his adopted mother was more than happy to indulge.  Over the course of the next decade, Rukia groomed Kriv to become her successor in the various arts of rougery, starting off from petty theft and pick-pocketing, and eventually graduating to learning all the ways to kill a man, whilst remaining hidden within the dark and shady places that existed beyond the comfort of Red Larch. It was sometimes grim work, but gradually, Kriv became numbed to what he was doing. Not all of the work was dark however, as Rukia also took enjoyment out of stealing from the rich, and giving back to the poor on a regular basis.  But ultimately, after Kriv became an adult at age 15, Rukia knew in her heart that she couldn't keep watching over him forever. After a long, heart-to-heart talk, Kriv and Rukia eventually concluded that they would both need to go their separate ways, in order for the dragonborn to continue to grow in his own way, without anyone else looking over him. After a hearfelt hug, and a few shed tears, Rukia left her former protege, packed her things, and left Brindol for parts unknown.  Ever since becoming a true apprentice rogue, Kriv has been spending his time accepting odd jobs from pretty much anyone in Red Larch who can pay for his services, plying his beginner skills in the hopes that, one day, he might find a clue that leads him to discovering the fate of his true birth-parents, and finding out what really happened that caused him to be abandoned in the first place.

Keep the prompt short and return it without quotation marks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Libitia is the daughter of Eadric Melandron, a revered paladin who had grown lonely in his duties, and desired to start a family of his own. Sadly, this desire was seemingly crushed when a fateful battle with a dark sorcerer resulted in him being struck with a spell that effectively rendered him sterile. Heartbroken by this, Eadric prayed and pleaded to his deity Sune, the Chaotic Good goddess of love and beauty. Felling sympathetic to the decorated paladin's plight, Sune sent down a celestial being to provide him comfort, and angel named Fidele. Through Fidele's holy blessing, she took on a human form, and was able to infuse Eadric with some of her own fertility, long enough to undertake an intensely pleasurable copulation, after which Fidele bore an Aasimar child, and brought her into the material world.  Eternally grateful for this second chance, Eadric did everything he could to raise Libitia the best that he could, teaching her the values of goodness and valor, of mercy and helping your fellow man, and of the many dangers that lie within the outside world. Despite having her own celestial duties to attend to, Fidele also took fairly regular departures to the material realm to teach her daughter all about life and love. The birds and the bees, the differences between love and lust, intimacy, the works. As Libita grew older, she quickly developed the signs of emerging divine magic inherent to her kind, but was intensely more fascinated with the arcane schools of magic, much to her father's confusion. She also developed a knack for playing Eadric's old family viol as an instrument, which became her primary hobby outside of magic studies. Her magic skills soon developed after being enrolled into the local wizarding college, and the youthful aasimar developed a curious fixation on the illusory school of wizardry, experimenting with creating visual images that represented aspects of the domain in which her divine mother resided. Libitia was more introverted during this time in her life, and while her beauty caused many a boy or man to pine after her, the aasimar always sought to wait for that \"special someone\". Someone who would love her for being her.  As a young adult, Libitia was growing into an illusionary savant, while also playing her viol for small crowds on the side, but she was also realizing that many people in this world were suffering unjustly, whether under the foots of other who abused their power, or at the hands of the myriad of monsters that roamed the world. It eventually came to a point where she actually felt guilty for the comfortable life she was leaving. This all came to a head one night, when Fidele came to her in an intensely-vivid dream. In this dreamscape, the angel of love told her half-celestial daughter that a woman whose children had gone missing had prayed desperately to Sune for help for two days and two nights. Fidele knew of Libitia's growing uncertainty, and asked her if she wanted a chance to do some real good in the world, to help people like that woman. Libitia hugged her right then and there, emotionally replying....\"yes\". When the two women came to Earric the next morning, the now-aging father was happy to hear Libitia say that she now wanted to use her developing skills to go further out into the world, and provide real help to those who did not have her comfortable upbringing, and to those who were suffering, even though her magical talents were not what he expected.  And so, with Eadric and Fidele's blessings, Libitia voluntarily left the comfort of her home town, and set out on a journey to the town of Oakhurst, where mysterious disappearances and killings had been taking place. Wherever her travels took her, this would be the first step on a testing and trying journey the young Aasimar would never ever forget."}]}

Sileena is a tiefling warlock."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sileena Blaize was born amidst a caravan of travelling Tiefling gypsies, gifted in the arts of mysticism, seduction, and occasionally, assassination, depending on who could pay. Even from a young age, Sileena displayed a great degree of magical aptitude, and yet she she had always felt that something seemed...missing, as if there was something keeping her from fully unlocking her full potential. The young tiefling spent much of her childhood learning the ways of her gypsy peers, even practicing seduction on the young boys of either their own, or whatever town they happened to visit at the time.  Eventually however, when Sileena reached the age of 16, the gypsies were visited by the spirit that they worshiped with great fervor: a powerful fey spirit, that would often take the guise of a stunningly beautiful eladrin male. It was at this point that Sileena's grandmother, the gypsy elder, presented Sileena before the spirit, as a new pact-mate, for it was the budding magical gifts of the warlock that Sileena had demonstrated during her childhood. But in order to seal the pact, the spirit needed to take her into her bed in a mystical act of intimacy. Trembling with a mixture of fear, trepidation, and anticipation, the young Sileena was stripped down to her nubile body within her own tent by the spirit, before she was laid down to begin. The pact-bonding ceremony seemed to last the whole night, as Sileena's new, pleasurable experience crescendoed higher, and higher. But finally, in one great big climactic moment, the private ceremony was complete, and the Fey pact was sealed.  With the full range of her warlock gifts accessible to her, Sileena Blaize would go on to spend the next fifteen years refining, and honing her powers alongside her gypsy brothers and sisters, while also mastering the use of her well-endowed body to seduce whoever she wanted, and making a respectable sum of money in the process. But after such a long time amongst her collective family, the warlock became dissatisfied with her life, believing that setting out, and using her gifts as an adventurer, would allow her to continue growing in her own way.   After convincing her grandmother of this, the elder gifted her with a old, magical orb that has belonged to her mother, before she went missing shortly after she was born. She finally left the gypsies on her own, and set out into the wide world, with her first destination being the city of Greenrest. Despite the money she had made in the past, she soon discovered that it would not be enough for her to have a sustainable income. Faced with the uncomfortable possibility of living in the poor house, Sileena started advertising herself as a mercenary at her earliest opportunity, whilst also taking on-and-off work as an exotic dancer for whatever inn would take her at the time, hoping that the eventual rewards of such adventuring would enable her to avoid a life of prostitution."}]}

Asking Barrotz for help, Agama discovered that the language was Sylvan and started to learn the language in order to discover what was hidden.   After many long weeks of dead-ends and frustrations Agama managed to find a secret room not yet discovered by anyone. Inside was a preserved scroll written in Sylvan detailing how to control one's Ki, excited about this discovery Agama hurried to Barrotz with the scroll eager to try and learn how to harness the Ki.

Barrotz however wasn't able to do anything after several days of practice, growing frustrated and seeing Agama only able to summon a puff of wind declared that the scroll was useless. Agama was enamored by the teachings of the scroll and saw that the scroll was just one of many.   One night Barrotz stole the scroll and left the ruins leaving Agama by himself.

I was the firstborn of a poor family in the slums of Draconia. My mother, Shivan, died in childbirth, leaving me to be raised by my father, Gevran Ergashed. Being raised in the poor sections, I was quickly influenced by the violent nature of my neighbors, which my strict father did not approve of. He often told me all he ever wanted was to get me out of there. “But Lord Savras wants us here” he would always say. I was raised by the faith of Lord Savras, god of divination, truth, and fate. When I turned 7 years old, I was recruited into a gang known as The Black Sirens by the leader, a gray dragonborn by the name of Silver. They promised me the usual; fame, fortune, brotherhood. Silver was like a brother to me, so I made sure not to disappoint him. I was trained to gather information, by any means possible. I was forged into a killer. I swiftly moved up through the ranks, and by the time I was 10, had become a ruthless bounty hunter. With each man I killed, my reputation grew. I became known on the streets as ‘The Heartless One’, as I had never taken mercy on my target. I tried desperately to keep my father blind to what I was doing, as he would never approve. I was only able to keep the charade up for 3 years. When I was 13, I got back from a hunt late at night. My scales were cloaked with blood. I walked in the door, carrying a bloody sword with arrows in my arm. But my father was waiting for me. He took one glance at me and instantly knew what I had become. He told me no son of his would be a killer. He took out his whip and lashed me twice, leaving a large ‘X’ scar on my back. I lashed out at him, forgetting who he was and going by my training. I killed him in cold blood. By the time I had figured out what I had done, it was too late. He was unhealable. I knew I couldn’t stay, so I packed my things and made plans to head for the next town over. But as I walked outside, Silver appeared at my door. He peeked behind me and found what I had done.  And he congratulated me. He told me my father was only holding me back, and that I could be unstoppable now. Nothing to hide from, nobody to keep me from my future.  And the rage hit again. Silver was dead on my doorstep before I knew it. It was because of his gang that I had murdered my father, I was captured by my gang mates before leaving town. I was taken to Black Sirens HQ, the sewers. The leadership had passed to Blaze, a bronze dragonborn. Silver’s little brother. I was kicked out, and given one day before they would come after me, a courtesy they gave all traitors. If I was ever seen again, I would be captured, taken to Blaze, and killed. It was there, in the sewers underneath the Draconian dump, where I vowed to make things right with my father, and disband The Black Sirens. When I reached the next town, I started cursing to Lord Savras. Out of all the lives he could’ve given to me, he made me a killer, a traitor and a deserter. I blamed him for all of my problems. But when the rage had subsided, I asked him to change who he had made me. I realized I needed to reinvent myself. I rejected my family name, Kaval Ergashed, and took up my new identity. I became Mythheart, my version of the name the Sirens had given to me, so I would never forget what I am fighting for; but also, it was my way of carrying around my shame. Every time someone says my name, I am reminded of the crimes I’ve committed and the history I’ve made. I would never be worthy of my family name until then. After I left that town, I made way for the forest. I set up camp in a cave I discovered deep within. I stayed there for three nights, but on the morning of the fourth, I was awoken by the sound of hooves beating on the ground. I hobbled out of the cave to find a group of men in heavy armor. They called me by my new name, which I had not yet told anybody. They told me to gather my things, and I was taken away to an old marble monastery. It was there that I was told I had been called to Paladinship by Lord Savras himself. I told them there had to be a mistake, but they told me the instructions given by Lord Savras had been very clear. I attempted to refuse, but they told me Lord Savras would never allow it. Even if they hadn’t taken me, I still would’ve found my way. I was trained, against my will, in the Order of Lord Savras. I was trained slowly, learning the ways of stealth better than anything else. I made good friends with the cooks, an elf named Fern and a halfling named Sun. They had great talent, able to turn anything into a delicious meal. On the night before my official naming as Paladin, I was visited in my dreams by Lord Savras. He told me I needed to be a Paladin, it was my fate, and the world would not be the same if I thought differently.  I became a Paladin, much to my dismay. Most Paladins are honored, but I thought of it more as a curse. I was not happy, and I wanted to find a way out. After being released, I committed small crimes to try to rid my life of the power of Savras. But Lord Savras would never allow it. People started looking at me with respect instead of fear. Everywhere I went, I was honored as a Paladin. There were some, of course, who did not take kindly to me. But everywhere I went, I brought my past with. Just because I’m a Paladin doesn’t mean I can dishonor my vow to myself. My Paladinship only made my vow stronger. The Black Sirens are evil that I need to rid the world of. Every year, on November 24th, the anniversary of my father’s death, I return to Draconia to visit my parents at the cemetery. I make sure I am not seen or followed. I light a torch for each of them, then leave because I was not not ready to make things right. I needed to be stronger. I go to the monastery, where I stay for the night. I’ve started collecting delicacies from other lands to bring to Sun and Fern. The recruits always ate well that night. When I met the main group in Newton, I was trailing a member on a hunt. I found him in a tavern and discovered he was just a mere rookie. I gave him the choice of death or desertion. He was cooperative. I was glad he had turned away from the darkness. I left the building and prepared to leave Newton, when the fire started. I could not save the rookie. The year before I met up with the group, The Black Sirens found me at the cemetery. They’ll be expecting me when I go back, on the fifth anniversary of my father’s death. They must be taken care of when I return. I am ready. "}]}

Despair is a tiefling warlock."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"You thought you could betray ME?!\" The Old One, a Being Who Should Not Exist, screams in outrage at the slight figure standing before him. \"I gave you my power through the Pact. I GAVE you the power to fulfill your lifes mission. Many have felt your vile touch and ended up exactly as you desire! HOW DARE YOU REFUSE TO UPHOLD YOUR END OF OUR BARGAIN!!!\" The small figure smiles defiantly up at his 'benefactor'. \"Our bargain was your power for my soul. Your power has been granted and my soul is forfeit BUT your end of the bargain is not complete.\" He takes a low, mocking bow. His next words drip with venom. \"My lord.\" \"The bargain was for your power until I can fill the world with my namesake! Many suffer but not nearly enough! Not even by half! I say it is YOU who is trying to betray our bargain!\" Crimson eyes flash in a brilliant display of rage and power. The Old One glares angrily down at the young tiefling and tries to find flaw in his logic but cannot. He is indeed trying to take the soul of this powerful yet headstrong warlock. But he will not admit defeat nor admit he was trying to cheat. So he took it upon himself to alter the situation in his favor. He became fixated on erasing this foolish mortal from existence. Drawing forth the entirety of his incredible power, the Old One unleashed a wave of force with a singular purpose. To destroy all it touches. This included the forest around them, the countless numbers of creatures within and most importanly the annoyingly smug warlock Despair. But before that destructive wave could harm a single cell of anything within its range the world shifted. All color drained from the sky, the leaves, the creatures and even the power unleashed from the Old One. All became motionless, stopped in the moment. All save for the Old One and Despair. And one other. \"I think that will be QUITE enough out of the two of you!\" Chronos bellowed as he stepped forth through a rift in time. \"I absolutely despise stopping time like this but you've left me with no other alternative. Do you know how much energy this takes?! The only larger drain on my power came from a group of fools traveling backwards in time to try and rewrite history!\" The powerful figure of the Lord of Time stopped in the direct center between the Old One and Despair. He turned his fury first to the Old One. \"This is your SECOND warning in as many aeons! You can't simply destroy an entire ecosystem because of the irritation caused by a mortal! Any further infractions will result in erasure!\" The Old One's head shifted forward. Not quite a bow but more of a sad, sulking measure. \"What's the use of all this power if I can't destroy the things that irritate me?\" Chronos shook his head and waved his hand in a negligent manner. \"You can destroy your irritants, by all means! Just KEEP the destruction to what is irritating you! No more mass destruction unless brought about by prophesy!\" \"Yes Lord Chronos.\" the Old One intoned sadly. As he turned away and began sliding back to his own plane of existence a lowly muttered \"Asshole.\" could be heard faintly before he disappeared altogether. Chronos finally turned to face Despair who had been watching the Old One get torn a new orifice with the greatest amusement. \"Wipe that smile off your face, insect!\" Despair's face melted from amusement to glaring hatred. \"I am no in...\" \"SILENCE! You continue to exist ONLY because I did not want to listen to this Plane's protector file a complaint! I've been keeping my eye on what you've been doing with this power.\" Chronos held up a hand to stop the protest he knew was coming. \"Yes, yes. I know. 'I am Despair. My goal in life is to spread my namesake to the world that shunned me simply for existing.' I am WELL aware of your intentions, your reasons. I even don't begrudge you your desire either. You mortals, who live so briefly yet so fiercely, are free to live your lives as you see fit. No. What I have been watching is HOW you've been doing it. Using the power granted from the Old One to twist the minds of those around you into doing things they should not do and only freeing their minds when the task is complete so they can live the rest of their lives in utter misery at doing precisely what they would never do.\" At this point Chronos paused to take a breath from his tirade and gave Despair some time to speak. However limited that time would be depended on how Despair answered. \"I used magic to charm those heartless bastards, yes. I cannot nor will I deny it. I'm proud of it. BUT! I did not twist any minds. Every person charmed. Every person who did such unspeakable acts. Did so because the desire to do it was within them in the first place! A husband's desire to remove his family from the picture so he could have the woman that wanted nothing to do with him when she found he was married. A child's desire to kill their friend so they can have that coveted toy. All we mortals possess darkness. I simply help them draw it out!\" Chronos looks thoughtfully down at Despair, stroking a beard that seems to eternally shift from the coarse black bristles of youth to the gray wispy strands of old age. \"You have a point, warlock. All you mortals do in fact possess darkness. But few act on it. And those majority that do not, do not for a reason you have failed to pick up on. All mortals ALSO possess light within them. That husband wouldn't have ever acted on his desire because his desire was fleeting. That woman completed his soul. His children gave him reason to lead a good life to set an example for his legacy. That child would never have acted on the impulse to kill his friend because he knew his friend was always willing to share his toys with his friend. You see only the darkness, Despair. Because you have blinded yourself to the light.\"  Stormy gray eyes bore into the mortal before him. \"Very well. I WAS going to destroy you utterly for your actions but I will not, now. I will give you a chance. This moment and all before it will be forgotten by you. By even your very body. I will turn back the clock for you and you alone. Your body will de-age to the point before your magical studies led you to forming a pact with the Old One. You will forget all spells and all powers granted by him. You will forget all time from that moment until now. All moments save for the knowledge that you became a warlock. The knowledge that you wished to fill the world with despair. And the knowledge that something profound has changed. And this shall all happen.\" \"NOW!\" Despair shouts as he wakes from his dream. \"Bloody nightmares! Always shocking you awake and leaving you with a feeling of dread but no recollection of what the damn thing was about!\" The sound of crunching paper turns his crimson gaze to what is held in his hand. Unfurling the length of parchment he begins to read. \"An invitation from....Lady Morwen? To her estate in Daggerford? What in the planes is a 'death house'?\" After some brooding over what to do and taking some time to shake off the remaining feeling of dread from that dream, a small smile tugged at his sinuous lips. \"Maybe these folks need a little despair in their lives. And Despair is only to happy to provide!\" As he exits a house he cannot for the life of him remember living in, he utters in a voice dripping with venom words he doesn't remember uttering a thousand times before. \"I just hope there aren't any bloody halflings!\""}]}

He was sold through the thriving slave business and ended up Galione. Vyurinn was sold to an old elven wizard, called Saevar, who used the vast  jungles of Mudai as his personal experimenting grounds for various rites and rituals. The young dragonborn was made to lug around gear for Saevar and do the general domestic chores in his home. The work wasn't too bad, Vyurinn had heard of plenty of slaves who were beaten, starved and misused. He even grew up sort of liking the old wizard, even if he wasn't the friendliest of the bunch, Vyurinn could see the humour in the mispleased Saevar's demeanor. It was because of Saevar that Vyurinn developed an interest in the arcane. He picked up stray bits of lore, even if Saevar did his best to hide it all. He grew ever more curious, until one day he snuck into the old elf's library to look at some books. Here, he read grand tales of other planes of existence and read of great dragons, even draconic gods! He started sneaking into this library more and more. He eventually found a dusty old tome, which spoke of making contact with these other planes he had read so much about. After dreaming about the place for so long, he eventually gathered up his courage and started stealing the needed supplies, relying on the trust he built with Saevar, along with the elf's old age to get away with it. Eventually he managed to gather everything and set out to attempt the ritual. What he did attempt, went horribly wrong however. The ritual not only failed, but caused the entire house to collapse in on itself. Vyurinn was knocked unconscious. In this dreamstate, he saw beautiful visions of seven grand mountains, surrounded by silvery lakes. He saw a giant castle built in these mountains, made of mithral, surrounded by several dragons flying around it. One of these dragons took notice of him and spoke to him. It was an ancient female silver wyrm, who introduced herself as Vaexthuril. As they spoke, Vaexthuril saw the good and kind heart of Vyurinn and the predicament he was in. She offered him freedom of his bonds, along with certain power, if only he would go out into the world and spread good, helping those in need and vanquishing evil. Vyurinn eagerly accepted. Eventually, he awoke in a bed, with a halfling over him, tending to his wounds. The tiny halfling was startled, but welcomed Vyurinn back to the land of the living. He was in a temple of Ilmater, where they had been tending to him. He explained that he had been unconscious for several days after having a house fall down on him. Apparently everyone thought that the old wizard had finally gone too far in his arcane doings and had led to his own demise. How lucky Vyurinn must be to still be alive! Realising that the truth would lead to nothing good, Vyurinn kept his mouth shut. The halfling eventually left him to rest some more. Vyurinn felt a renewed vigor wash over him and saw his wounds close before his eyes. He felt energized and decided he should leave as soon as possible. He got up and walked out of the temple, thanking the halfling, who was shocked to see him walking around, seemingly uninjured. He left Galione and set out into the world, helping where he could, learning various arcane secrets on his travels."}]}

Dayven is a halfling paladin."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I spent most of my life as a humble farmer, working the land and tending my family’s livestock. My village was simple, and we thought the world a much smaller place than it is. But that all changed one day. The first sign of trouble was the goblin raids. They were infrequent at first, but it grew into a war. The Goblin War. Something had to be done, so after the fourth goblin attack I founded a militia to protect the village, and we called ourselves the Brotherhood of Pitchforks. I trained the villagers to fight using our makeshift weapons: hoes, axes, pitchforks, and the like. As the goblin’s attacks became more ferocious, so did we in the Brotherhood. It was five years from the first goblin raid to the end of the war, and I think we must have exterminated the goblins. By this point many of us villagers were seasoned veterans, so when the giants showed up, wanting to take our land and force us to pay taxes to their king, we resisted. We fought off their first attack easily enough, they hadn’t expected much from a village of halflings, but after a while they came back bringing all their tools of war. Humans really are remarkable warriors when they put their minds to it, and their massive size at nearly twice the height of a halfling gives them an edge. The trick is to go for their knees, and to keep your shield skyward. At one point during the battle, a trebuchet destroyed the granary, and at this point I become flooded with a righteous fury. This was the point that the god of strength had chosen me, and it was as if I was indestructible. I fought and killed two hundred human warriors that day, and the few that remained were terrified of me. But they placed a bounty on my head so large that others would come and assault my village, trying to get at me. Eventually I had to leave for the sake of everyone else. And now I am on the road, a wanderer, wondering why the god chose me."}]}

Modoc is a human wizard."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "CR 98 “I am tired Grandfather, why have I been summoned,” the old man whined. “I have served the family for over three hundred years, but the life extending magics are exhausted, and I’m ready to die.” The cold voice drifted across the ancient tower, “Three hundred years? Empires are laid low for the secrets that gave you those three hundred years, and yet you protest. Your family requires your services, and yet you protest. You disappoint me Archmage Terem yn Ujemi.” The creature, with a gesture, waved away the further titles. The old man bowed his head in rebuke. “I am sorry for my insolence Grandfather, but my divinitions have revealed this to be the day of my death. I do not understand what I can do for you with so little time left.” “Less than an hour to be precise.” If the mercurial creatures face held pity or compassion it did not show, though its gesture was one of paternal familiarity. “I require one last obedience of you grandson of my grandson,” the lich said. “Candlekeep has turned away my agents. Olmur, the new Keeper of Tomes has decreed that seekers can stay no more than a ten day, and only the avowed now have direct access to the library. To fully preserve the revelations of Alaundo, he claims. I cannot abide being denied access. I need an agent in the library to conduct my research”. “What of Candlekeep? Myth Drannor rises to greater heights everyday. Its libraries have long past eclipsed that of those odd monks and their chanting circles. I do not understand! I am to die today, how can I be of any further help to the family in this matter?” Terem asked. \"Mulhorand slain, Mystryl sacrificed, when even Gods fall what are the works of mortals. Narfell and Rauathar are ghostly echoes of the past. Calamities will come again and those that are high will be felled, those that are low will become ascendant. Cities that do not yet exist will have high kings not yet born. It is not the past you work toward, or even the present.\"   For a man at the end of his life, the past was all his mind could think of. His eyes followed the form of the creature his mother had brought him to almost two hundred ninety years ago, she had called him Grandfather also. He remembered the tears in her eyes, now long gone to the house of the dead. “For the family,” she had said leaving the crying youth behind. Terem saw the lich pause on front of a table, on it was a book. The title read, “First Expedition to the Shadow Plane. Journal of Killium the Arcanist of Xinlenal”. Other objects the Archmage could easily identify as common in the enchantment of an item, other things, though his knowledge of magic was vast, were unfamiliar to him. \"Karsus's Folly cost me much,\" the once human creature said, his hollow voice ringing through the hall. \"So much of my power was lost, it has taken years to recover. In truth, I have not and cannot ever return to the heights I once held. I have learned patience though, through my long years. It is a virtue you shall now have to learn as well.\" \"I am confused Grandfather. I do not,\" Terem started. As the lich turned he saw in its hand a ornate pendant, princely in its worth. Then he saw the Athame. \"No Grandfather\". Archmage Terem felt his muscles seize, despite his considerable will and defences. The chants of the lich echoing in the workroom. He tried to focus on his years of arcane training and research, lost and forbidden knowledge he had gleaned from dusty and forgotten towers. All came to the same conclusion, there was nothing that could be done. The divinitions were correct, he would die this day. \"Less than a few moments left grandson\". It seemed to Terem that he almost heard regret in the empty voice. If it existed it did not stop the inexorable arc of the ceremonial blade or the brief pain that followed. \"I shall keep your phylactery with me, protected from all harm,\" the creature stated in between chants. He lifted the book and placed it on the corpse of the old mage. Skeletal fingers clutched the cover and opened it, holding it deathly still as it brought an ivory pen inscribed with runes, it nib filled with a golden ink gleaming with its own inner light. With death, the cold fingers of fear had released Terem. It surprised him to find oblivion did not follow. He was still aware. Although blinded, knowledge of his surroundings still filled his senses. Throwing out this awareness he watched the creature he called Grandfather work with calm precision, tirelessly anointing the edges of each page with tiny runes. \"No Terem, there is no peace in death for either of us, we shall continue to protect our family. For you, Candlekeep will be your home, protect it well. In the years to come when your shade rises in its defence you will be looked upon as a guardian of the walled library. They will think nothing of your ghostly form roaming its halls. They will tell themselves you were once of the avowed. All while you obtain for me the knowledge that I need. The tomes that others bring will enhance my knowledge. If Candlekeep falls, mayhap you will end up in another useful library.\" The spirit once known as the Archmage Terem continued to watch dispassionately as the lich he once called Grandfather patiently waited for the golden ink to dry and start again. It was over a hundred pages before the spirit realized the creature would press unduly hard on the nib pressing the ink deeply through the page. It took almost a thousand before the shade understood. The inhuman thing that worked ever so patiently felt the spirits understanding, and was pleased. \"Your phylactery holds your soul, while the book holds your spirit. As long as your soul is protected the book cannot be truly destroyed. It will always reform and call your spirit back. It is the only one of its kind, and Candlekeep will always desire you returned.\" It continued to speak, uncharacteristically verbose, pleased with its own guile. \"As long as you are in the library, I shall enter at my leisure. The monks will look at each page with care, the magics obvious even to a dullard. They will check each page carefully, first one side then the other, their study will be most thorough. The Avowed lack the wit to discern what I have hidden, for the magic circle I have created does not run along its pages, but through them. In as long as this hidden gate exists, with your awareness to draw me in, no ward now or in the future shall prevent my entry.\" As the echo of his voice faded from the chamber the lich drew the final rune on the final page. The chant of many magics filled the air, some of the spells Terem recognised, non-detection, protection, and some he did not. As if to mark the end of his labors, the lich pressed his left skeletal hand onto the inside of the front cover, leaving a black claw print in the tome. Finally, the lich called for his servants. If the awareness that had been Syl-Vizer Terem yn Ujemi yn Sardikar el makhlab-dabab yi Memnon could be startled the sight of his former apprentice, a nephew,  entering would have done so. There had been no sense of time, but the boy he had left was now aged and bent. \"Grandfather,\" He said, his eyes wide with fear as he received his instructions and scurried out of the room. House Talonmist traces their lineage back to the great diviner Sardikar Makhlb-dabab, descended from the Djinn, Imperial Dreamer of Calimshan and called the talon in the mist by his enemies now long dead. After being granted a vision foretelling of the Red Plague of -990 DR he fled north from Calimport with his family. Despite his attempt to save them, all except his youngest child perished in the plague. He railed against the arbitrary nature of the plague and his impotence in aiding his family. Sardikar became obsessed with the study of disease and death. He travelled the world with a singular purpose, he would defeat death and protect his lineage.  His obsession led him to seek a greater understanding of the dark arts and necromancy. Seeking to tease out the secrets of lichdom, as a means of forestalling his death; and by extension guiding and securing the legacy of his family.   Since then the he has shepherded the various branches around Faerûn, and watched from afar. For generations they bred and scattered across the Sword Coast and Western Heartlands. Acting as an unassuming family of merchants while slowly gathering magical lore and secrets. Tahlaunmiiz was the name his descendants bore in Westgate, Talonmist in Waterdeep. Though throughout the centuries, those descendants of both houses who showed an aptitude for the arcane mysteries would be sent off the family seat of \"Kingsgrave Manor\". Where they were to apprentice under the immutable patriarch, the lich Sardikar Makhlb-dabab, the talon in the mist.  In recent years the Talonmist family has been embroiled in a simmering feud with the Harpells, an upstart family of wizards from Longsaddle. Whom have disrupted Talonmist activities and acquisitions in the past. Members of the opposing families have even been known to engage in duels to the death when tensions boil over. The Talonmists also harbor a cold relationship with the Red Wizards, seeing the new expansion of the merchant-mages into the Sword Coast as a threat to the family business.  It is in this time, some 2,500 years after the exodus from Calimshan, that Modoc was born. The second of Jaheira and Ajantis Talonmist's three children, his early childhood was free of any significant turmoil or crisis. Modoc's parents made their living as spice merchants in the bustling port city of Waterdeep; and while they were not wealthy, they lived a comfortable lifestyle. This afforded their children the opportunity to receive an education. It was in this environment of learning and study that Modoc began to thrive. He read voraciously, sometimes late into the night and would often be gently scolded by his mother, for using to many candles when caught.   However, it would not be long before Modoc's education became a source of umbrage. The normally peaceful home would erupt with cantankerous argument. As the young savant challenged the teachings of his tutors, in subjects that encompassed everything from theological matters, to natual theories, and even the wonders of the higher mysteries. The study was often a room in the throws of raucous debate, in which Modoc's energy was spent disputing, correcting, and badgering his tutors. All the while demanding evidence of their teachings. Invariably these educators would resign amid a string of curses as they stormed from the family home. These resignations began to become a burden on the family finances, we well as a disruption to the education of their other children. Finding no other recourse for the dangerous intellect of their son the parents decided it was time. They sent a message, and received a response. Modoc was to be delivered to Kingsgrave Manor, where he would examined and tested; and if he was deemed worthy he would be formally apprenticed to the venerable \"Grandfather Sar\".   The precocious youth was sent east by carriage and arrived at an ancient fortified manor house set atop one of the rolling hills north of the town of Triel. The manor itself seemed to be built over many centuries. With evidence of several different construction phases and techniques, giving the structure an overall disjointed and bizarre appearance. Once admitted into the enigmatic building Modoc was questioned at length. Scrutinized by robed men and women of unclear relation to the boy though they bore a distinct resemblance to his father. Eventually he was taken to an antechamber deep in the vaults under the manor, the door to the room beyond was covered in luminous blue runes. At this point his robed guides instructed Modoc to \"Wait here\" before the pair turned and hurried from the crypt-like atmosphere of the vaults.  Several hours passed before the door swung open as if by some invisible force. It took Modoc a moment to summon to courage to enter. When he did the scene the greeted the boy nearly overwhelmed his senses. Smoke from burning incense hung in several gilded brazzers perfuming the air. A small library's worth of the tomes and scrolls sat in a massive, overstuffed, bookshelf and many more lay stacked on the floor and tables throughout the room. A number of crystals arcing electricity, hovered in place, occasionally shifted from one side of the room to the other.  In a corner sat a wooden table of polished ebony holding carefully arranged and straightened lengths of hair. Each set is tied together with bright blue string. The  sigil of house Talonmist covered much of the floor. The design is cut into the floor and its tiny channels are full of glistening mercury. In the center of the room stood the desiccated and mummified figure of Grandfather Sar. He was clothed in ivory colored robes trimmed with gold, his fingers and throat heavy with jewellery. Small crystalline stones floated above his head, atop which sat a circlet made of opalescent stone. The only thing that kept the boy from fleeing the chamber was sheer awe. As Grandfather Sar reached out a skeletal hand to gesture the youth forward he said \"You need not fear me my child. But know this, your existence shall be that, which I weave for you out of sorrow and woe.\"  Initially Modoc split the majority of his days either assisting his master with alchemical experiments, deep in study, or carefully aiding with embalming rituals to fortify the liches deteriorating form. Though as the years progressed Modoc's apprenticeship became an affair of extremes. In one moment Grandfather Sar would patently guide the young mage through the intricacies of The Weave and spellcraft. The next the old lich would set impossible goals for any budding wizard to attain. And when Modoc would inevitably fail, his master was harsh and unforgiving. Evidence of the lich's cruelty was most evident at the end of his time at Kingsgrave Manor.  He was told by Grandfather Sar to prepared to a journey to the Shadowfell, no doubt so the lich could achieve some secret end. The process seemed simple; an aperture opened like a jaw, and swallowed them and they passed into another space. But something happened when the pair attempted to plane shift. And an error left Modoc separated from his master and alone in the Feywild.   At first he could only stare, open-mouthed, stunned at the resplendent natural beauty before him. But he was soon shocked out of this trance. The sound of his master's voice boomed inside of his head. \"Return triumphant or die forgotten\" the old lich said, and then it was silent.  By happenstance or destiny, Modoc had entered the Feywild in the territory of a Brass dragon named Parthanax. The dragon kept a keen eye on its domain and quickly \"collected\" the spellcaster as a sort of curio. Parthanax brought Modoc back to its lair, \"The Grand Hall of Conversation\" where it spent the majority of its time entertaining friends and visitors. The lair also contained an elegant foyer, a gallery for the artwork the dragon collected, sleeping chambers, of course a treasure vault that housed the dragon's horde. Pathanax loved to engage his guest in hours of long winded debate, and Modoc was no exception. This environment suited the young mage and he spent countless hours in deep conversation with the dragon and it's visitors. During his time in the Feywild, Modoc learned answers to questions his had not know to ask. After several months with the dragon he was able to convince Pathanax to send him back to the Material Plane.  He entered near Luskan and was quickly able to make his way to the city. Penniless and far from home, he initially tried to acquire the coin for the journey by taking the moniker Modoc the Magnificent and plying his trade as a street magician. Though it didn't take long to realize that more direct action was necessary. He hired on with a group of adventurers, the party consisted of Gorignak a goliath berserker, James the Younger a sly priest of Tymora, and Kamali a half-elf troubadour. They had been tasked with escorting an elderly priest South to Neverwinter, a city still recovering from the ravages of the Spellplague. The companions made good time on the road to Neverwinter, and delivered the abbot safe and sound to his temple in the city. The group spent little time in Neverwinter before heading South toward Waterdeep, where Modoc planed to part ways with his acquaintances and continue on to Kingsgrave Manor alone.  When the adventurers arrived in the village of Oakhurst, on the road south of Neverwinter, the villagers beseeched the party for their help. Kobolds had taken up residence in a nearby ravine, and had been stealing livestock from local farmers. With the promise of reward the party set out the clear the kobold lair. But in a strange turn of events, the minstrel Kamali, was able to negotiate a treaty with the villagers and the kobold matriarch Yidrasil. From there the group traveled on toward Waterdeep, but the adventurers would never make it. In a roadside inn they heard a rumor, a young dragon had ousted a group of dwarves from their mine near Mirabar. Anyone who could clear the mine stood to profit greatly. All Modoc had to hear was \"dragon\" to start making excuses to postpone his trip home and urge the group back north.  After a few weeks of travel the explorers had reached the mine of Khundakar and began preparations to plumb it's depths. The place was cavernous and seemed to descend for miles. When the group had finally reached the bottom, they found their quarry. A black dragon the size of an ettin. The beast fought ferociously but in the end, the creature fell to spellfire and force of arms. After gathering samples from the dragon, while the others gathered treasure. Modoc and the party set out for the mine's exit. Upon reaching the surface, the group encountered a single human male dressed in dark leather. The man introduced himself as Antony and stated he belonged to a group that specializes in the finding and acquisition of magic items known as the Black Hand. Impressed that the party had beaten him to the punch. He offered them a job on the spot, and with it an opportunity to join this network of shadowy archaeologists and tomb raiders.   *Caught up in the excitement and promise of the whole affair, within days the friends and new employer were on a ship bound for Chult. Modoc was sure his master would overlook the delay when he returned with the arcane secrets gathered from such a mysterious land. They sailed into Refuge Bay, the coastal settlement of Ishau sank into sea during Spellplague and the city’s stone buildings lay submerged a few hundred yards off shore. The party disembarked on to the beach at the southeastern edge of the bay. On the shore sat a small fishing village constructed out of driftwood, palm fronds, and materials scavenged from the ruined city. Modoc and his companions entered the village and after offering gifts to the locals they were able to secure a guide. They stayed the night in a small driftwood hut offered by the chieftain. All except Modoc who was forced to sleep in the small rowboat they had brought ashore due to the villagers mistrust of magic. In the morning the party, except Modoc, received some parting gifts and blessings from the tribe before heading into the sweltering jungle.   By this time Antony had become the tacit leader of the group. He spent most of his time conferring with the guide, checking his map, and reassuring the adventurers they were on the right track. In contrast, Gorignak told tall tales of his many feats of strength and taphouse exploits to anyone who would listen. The minstrel Kamali was constantly plucking at his mandolin and tuning its strings while complaining about the humidity warping his instrument. All the while James whispered silent prayers to Tymora as his eyes darted about searching the foliage and undergrowth for any sign of danger. In total the journey took four day before the party finally caught sight of the temple of Tamoachan. This ancient shrine had lay forgotten for centuries and had only recently been located by the Black Hand. The massive limestone step pyramid that greeted them was engulfed by the vines and moss, looking like a fang pushing up through the jungle floor.   It was decided that Antony and the local guide would maintain a camp while the rest of the group entered and cleared the temple. They entered through a sinkhole that had opened up next to the structure and caused part of its foundation to collapse. Pushing through the lower levels they encountered a poisonous haze that hung in the air and sapped at their strength. They were further impeded hazardous traps and the denizens of the temple. Eventually the party reached the upper levels of the pyramid and the miasma faded. After entering the throne room of the temple they were faced with a long forgotten undead chieftain that had ruled over Tamoachan in years past. After defeating this threat the group was faced with one last obstacle.   An Oni occupied the highest level of the structure and stood between the party and the exit. The friends steeled themselves for battle against the demon. Gorignak charged forward striking at the Oni wildy with his massive gleaming axe. James moved to flank the creature where he could attack from the demon’s blind spot. Kamali and Modoc stood further away slinging spells at the beast. With a simple gesture from the Oni the entire chamber became freezing winds and driving snow, obscuring the party's vision. Before they could react the demon teleported between the two spell casters. Bringing down it's massive clawed hand down upon Modoc and with a single mighty blow sent the wizard flying across the room. Modoc's broken body slammed into the wall and fell to the floor. When the mage gathered enough strength to stand up and the stars cleared from his eyes he saw the Oni's claw clutching tightly Kamali’s lifeless body by the throat. Gorignak rushed frantically to cut down the fiend that had slain their friend. The barbarian’s progress was slowed by the freezing gales, but upon reaching the beast he landed many savage blows, splattering it's black blood throughout the room. A few meters away to Modoc’s right, James kneeled to steady himself as he fired arrow after arrow into the fray. Then, to the wizard's horror, he witnessed to fell creature’s clawed hand reach into Gorignak’s chest. And then retract with the barbarian’s in its grasp. The goliath managed to shrug off the wound just long enough to land one final blow before falling, almost cleaving the Oni’s head form it's body. With it's black blood spewing from many savage wounds the demon summoned it's dying strength. It raised a bloody hand and sent forth a deadly cone of freezing energy in a last attempt to kill the remaining intruders.   Only Modoc emerged from the temple. The mage struggled as he drug Kamali’s body into the green light of the Chultan jungle. The forms of his two other fallen friends floated upon a floating disk that followed a few meters behind the wizard. "}]}

I lived with my Family; my mother was an elf, a stunningly gorgeous woman with beautiful golden blond hair and deep golden eyes. She was one of the kindest people that I have ever know. My father was in many ways different, he was a devil, a strong sturdy man whose silver hair and flame red eyes drew you to him; despite how he looked he was also extremely kind and he and my mother were completely in love. But that's just what I remember from the few short years that I got to spend with them.  For the first few years of my life that I can remember everything was amazing, I spent the days playing with my parents and my dad even taught me some basic magic tricks, he praised me telling me that I had learned them faster than even he did, we spent life as a normal family, or so I thought.  When I was only 5 a strange change seemed to come over my parents, we stopped going out as often; when we did I had to wear these strange clothes that didn't fit very well. Then shortly after my 6th birthday my father started to get horns on his head, I was super excited for him they looked really cool, but my father always tried to hide them when we went out; I couldn't understand why. I think it happened about 5 months later that a man came to the door, something was strange though as soon as my father saw him he changed, he was a bit scary and my mother took me to the bedroom where we stayed for what seemed like forever. eventually my father came into the room, my mother put me into the bed and told me to go to sleep; of course after all that had happened I couldn't just go to sleep so I pretended and when my parents had been gone to the front room for a while I snuck up to the door and listened as hard as I could.  What I heard didn't make much sense, my mother and father both seemed to be really upset and the only things I understood was that the man who had just come worked for my father's brother. this was news to me I never knew I had more family out there; why had I never met him, why did this man who worked for my uncle make my parents so upset. my mother started to cry for some reason and my father just hugged her, after it started getting mushy I went back to bed and fell asleep.  The very next day was a blur, my parents were going in and out of the house all day and told me to stay inside and practice some of my magic tricks; I enjoyed magic so I didn't mind. it was late and I was getting hungry so I asked mother for something, she told me to hold on a moment and then gave me some kind of strange glass. she told me it was a new drink that she had made just for me and wanted me to tell her how it tasted; it tasted strange, first it was like cherry, then honey, then it was some wierd taste that I couldn't figure out but I finished it. I told my mother it tasted great and she gave me the smile that I loved; and my father patted me on the head and told me he loved me.  That was the last time I ever saw my father. I woke up in a blurry daze and called out for my mother, she reached over and held my hand petting my hair and asking me to be quiet for a little while. after I had fully woken up I looked at my mother to see tears, and something I had never seen on her face before but that I now understand was fear. I asked where father was and all she would say is not now; the fear seemed to infect me and I sat quietly huddled in my mother's arms finally noticing that we were moving along a bumpy path in what seemed to be a wagon.  We stayed like that for a long time, finally my stomach started growling so loud that my mother was able to hear it, she petted my head and handed me a small loaf of bread. it was strange I had never had this kind of bread before it had a strange taste that I couldn't place. my hunger satiated and my fear reduced I became curious again and started to look around. that is when I noticed that we were alone in the wagon and that outside was someplace that looked completely different from where we lived, we were going through a huge forest. since I have always been able to see in the dark I didn't realize at first but it was really pitch black outside and we seemed to be moving at a good pace.  I asked my mother what was going on, she looked at me and said, \"you have been asleep for three days, your father was taken; we are going to a hidden place where we will be safe\". it was too much information that didn't make sense all at once; I shut down trying to figure out what was going on from what my mother had said. three days, I had been asleep for three days; and somehow while I was asleep someone or something had taken my father, but who in the world could be strong enough to take my father? it didn't make sense and where was this safe place, safe from who? nothing made sense and I couldn't handle that; I went blank and the next thing I remember was the wagon coming to a abrupt stop and hearing shouting.  Coming back to the real world to find your mother in a panic is something that is hard to experience but it was probably the fact that I was till in shock that saved my life, my body took over as my mind reeled at what was happening. my mother grabbed my hand and we both jumped from the wagon, seconds later the wagon exploded behind us throwing us into the trees on the side of the path. my mother stood me up and we raced through the trees, it was still pitch black so my mother was tripping over things here and there, I came back to my senses enough to understand that we needed to run and my mother couldn't see. I took the lead and as we raced through the trees the light started to come back.  Once we had a little light my mother took back over and we changed directions a few times, I had no idea where we were or where we were going but my mother seemed like she knew exactly. we ran for what seemed hours and finally I collapsed, my mother tried to get me to go on but everything that had happened had just hit me and I just curled up and wouldn't move. my mother sat next to me, laid my head on her lap and smoothed my hair whispering to me and telling me it would be alright, telling me that I had been brave and that we had gotten away. I calmed down thanks to her and was able to fall asleep on her lap.  It was light when I woke up still on my mother's lap, but something was wrong, she was cold not her normal warming presence. she seemed to be asleep, but she wouldn't wake up to my calling her, or when I tried to shake her awake. when I tried to shake her again she fell over and that was when I noticed. the tree that she had been leaning against was covered in blood; but that didn't make sense, why would the tree be covered in blood. when I went over to help my mother up I put my hand on her back but it was wet so I pulled away, now my hand was covered in blood; why was my mothers back covered in blood just like the tree? it came to me slowly as I didn't want to accept it, I fought it but it just kept coming back; it's her blood. by why, why was my mother's blood all over her back and the tree? because she's dead...that thought struck me cold; I knew it but how could I accept it. my mother the kind and beautiful woman that I had known for my entire life, gone.  I just sat there, completely locked in the mental battle between my grief and my intellect telling me different things. it was some time later when my intellect started to overcome my grief that I realized I needed to find out where I was. I got up and started looking around, realizing that it was getting dark again. as I looked around I noticed that some of the trees in the direction my mother had been facing looked different, I went over to inspect them. to my horror I found that not only the trees but what appears to have been three elves burnt to a crisp and lying on the ground; what had drawn my attention to this space was all the charring on the surrounding trees. after my stomach expelled what seemed to be nothing by acid, I was starving, thirsty, and still dazed after having seen my first dead bodies ever.  I didn't want to leave my mother but I had to find something to eat and drink. luckily one of the magic tricks my father had taught me allowed me to summon a bit of water. I scooped out a hole in the dirt and summoned my magic, I placed a small stone in the center of the hole and called out \"Drench\". this summoned a small torrent of water that drenched the stone and filled the hole. the water was nice on my throat after all of the stomach acid and I drank my fill. now I just needed to figure out how to get some food.  When my father first started out teaching me magic he taught me the spell \"Prestidigitation\" telling me to master that and I would be able to get the hang of magic, I never saw a whole lot of uses to the spell since it was mostly to practice summoning my magic but I realized now that it could be of some use, I grabbed some grass and used the spell to flavor it to my liking, it wasn't amazing but it did at least fill my empty stomach. not that I had food and water in me I needed to figure out what to do about my mother. I wanted to figure out what had happened to her, and figure out what to do now.  Upon looking at my mother a little longer I realized that she had something clutched in her hand. she seemed to have been hanging onto it when she died. it was pretty hard to open her hand, but I was eventually able to get her hand open and found a piece of paper. on the paper written in what I could only assume was blood was a final message from my mother. \"i am going to die, I have known this ever since you fell asleep, I must have been hit with something when the wagon exploded. I know that your scared and I am sorry that I can't be there for you anymore. I have hidden some magical traps to hopefully stop anyone that comes after you. I feel that I owe you more of an explanation but I fear I don't have time; so to explain as best as I can... your father was forced to return home by his family, you should not go after him, he did this to protect us from his family. we were on our way to a dark-elf haven, a place where there are others such as yourself. we were ambushed by elves looking to learn the location of the haven. burn my body and then you must run, do not trust any elves that you see. I love you.\"  I must have read that letter five or six times, I didn't understand why elves were after us, my mother was an elf... and why would my father have to leave to protect us from his family, none of this made any sense. the thing that stuck out to me were the last things in the letter, the only things I could make sense of at the moment; run, don't trust elves, and the final words of love from my mother. I folded up the note and put it into my pocket; I hoped I would eventually be able to figure out what the rest of the message was talking about. before I could leave I needed to follow the last thing my mother told me to do, burn her body. I didn't want to say goodbye to her yet but I couldn't just leave her and it was the last thing my mother asked of me. I grabbed some twigs and sticks from around the clearing and put them around my mother, I summoned my magic and cast \"Ignite\" setting flame to the only family that I had. I now was without father or mother and had no idea what to do other that what my mother had told me, so I ran.  I ran through the forest completely devoid of a specific direction or purpose, just running. something stopped me dead in my tracks, and it took me a moment to figure out what; it was voices. I crouched down into a bush and stayed as still as I could listening for the voices. it seemed to be three people and from what I could hear of their conversation they were quite agitated. they had lost a few people and couldn't find what they were looking for. it slowly dawned on me that the thing they were looking for was me and mom, and that the people they were missing must have been those bodies I had found. I stayed still not sure what to do, listening to them as they seemed to be coming closer, I just hoped that they wouldn't find me, I didn't think I could fight them.  Behind me a twig snapped and the people started coming in my direction at a much swiffer pace crushing leaves and twigs as they came, but I had no idea what had snapped that twig behind me and that thought kept me rooted to my spot in the bush afraid to move. as the people came into view through the bush I saw that they were all three elves, although their anger seemed to make them much less beautiful than mother had been. They slowed as they approached the area where the sound had come from and I was afraid that they would hear my pounding heart through my chest and the bush and know I was here. but it seems they couldn't and they went past my hiding spot and headed farther back. now that they were past me and their backs were turned I felt like I had to get out of there.  i snuck out of the bush as quietly as I could and made my way in the opposite direction of the elves. This is where it seems my luck ran out, I was just about out of there when there was a loud noise and I suddenly found myself upside down hanging from some kind of wire around my ankle; I was caught in a trap. the elves whipped around and started running towards me. when they were just in front and below me they started laughing as I struggled in my binding. one of the elves came forward a bit and spat at me just narrowly missing me with my wild swinging. \"So we finally found the little abomination, where is your whore of a mother little devil's spawn.\" I screamed my rage at them furious that they would insult me mother so soon after her death. They seemed to find this funny, one of them tossed a rock, hitting me on the head, and I could feel the wound start to bleed. \"tell us where she is or we'll make you bleed even more devil spawn.\" the nock to the head sent me over the edge of rage into a sort of calm fury and without even thinking about it I used drench on all three of the elves completely soaking them.  This seemed to have really piss them off as one of them pulled their bow and was about to shoot me when the one who first spoke stopped him. \"we need him to tell us where his mother is; shoot him in the leg.\" the elf raised his bow and white hot fire shot through my entire body as the arrow pierced my leg. I nearly passed out but managed to remain conscious out of sheer terror and fury. I gritted my teeth and summoned my magic and let loose the most powerful spell I knew \"Jolt\" electricity jumped from my hand and raced towards then elves. the leader threw up a hand hand blocked the spell but it must have surprised him because it deflected towards the one with the bow. as the elf with the bow was still soaked from the “Drench” spell the electricity must have been to much for him as he collapsed twitching on the ground.  that was the first time I had ever used my magic on someone else. I felt exhilarated and horrified at the same time, my stomach was in knots and I started to feel light headed; I wasn't sure if it was from pain or if I was running out of magic. the elves were both fumming at the mouths. the leader seemed to be keeping his head and wanted to torture me for information, the other one seemed to have lost it and just wanted to kill me right there. neither future was particularly appealing to me but I couldn't think of any way to get out of this predicament.  The elves seemed to come to an agreement about what to do with me, \"if you had just told us where your mother was you could have died together; but your just too much of a pain so were going to kill you first\". crap I had pushed them over the edge and I was out of power, I couldn't concentrate anymore because of the pain in my leg and the blood rushing to my head. the leader stepped back as the other elf brought out a bow and arrow, he brought the bow up and aimed the arrow right at my chest, I was dead, there was nothing I could do. suddenly the leader grabbed his neck and started choking; the elf with the bow turned around to see what had happened to the leader. as the elf turned a flash of black flew across the distance and landed in the elves forehead. both elves collapsed pretty much simultaneously as a tall woman completely covered from head to toe seemed to appear from a tree.  I couldn't believe my eyes, both elves were dead and this woman had appeared out of nowhere; was I saved? was I in even more danger? I kept silent hanging from the wire trying to remain conscious. the woman walked over to the elf that I had zapped with magic, bent over and slashed his throat; she then walked over to the elf with the bow and retrieved what appeared to be some kind of pointed black metal star. she flicked the blood from it and then with a flick of her wrist it disappeared. after all of that she looked up at me and asked \"are you afraid?\" I mean what kind of question is that, I was terrified; so I nodded. \"good, that means that you want to live.\" I nodded again. \"would you like to get down from there?\" I pointed to my leg with the arrow in it afraid to get down to hard. she nodded and lowered me down gently.  \"Now, I am going to numb your leg so that we can talk without you passing out from pain.\" just after she said that she proceeded to jab my leg in several places with her finger, it hurt at first but the pain receded and I was left with a sense of numbness in most of my body. I thanked her but I was still a bit weary of her, I new she could kill me in a second if I said the wrong thing. \"from what I saw, you put up a pretty good fight for a runt.\" she said. I looked up at her and replied \"i just acted on instinct\". she laughed \"people with that kind of instinct can be quite deadly when they grow up.\" I just kind of stared at her blankly not really understanding. the looked me over, \"you seem to be a dark elf, though not very old by the looks of it, I assume that's why they were looking for your mother?\" the question didn't seem to make any sense to me \"why would they be looking for my mother because of me?\" I asked. the woman looked at me but as her face was mostly covered I couldn't see what she was thinking \"it seems you are pretty ignorant of the world aren't you?\". that sounded pretty rude but I still didn't want to say the wrong thing so I just nodded. she chuckled \"well at least your able to admit it. now, if you'll tell me where your mother is I can help you find her.\" the stress and the fear and the pain of the day started to overwhelm me and I couldn't answer all I could do was cry. I cried for several minutes until I realized that she was just sitting there watching me; not saying anything, not doing anything. for some reason her calmness was calming me down as well; I didn't have the heart to explain what had happened so I reached into my pocket and took out the letter from my mother and handed it to woman.  After reading the letter the woman folded it back up and handed it back to me; \"you'll want to keep that I assume\". I thanked her and put the letter back into my pocket. The woman studied me for a moment and then said \"i have two questions for you. first, did you do what your mother asked and burn her body?\" I stared at her for a moment and then nodded that I had. she nodded back \"that must have been hard, but it's good that you did. As for my second question; in the letter it says that you were headed to a safe haven, since this seems to be the first time you have heard of it I will assume that you don't know the location...\" I shook my head that I did not. \"...that being the case my question for you is; what do you want to do?\" this question took me by surprise, how should I know what to do, all I have been doing is running like my mother's letter told me to do. I didn't have my mother or my father, I didn't know where I was, I still didn't understand why elves were after me. I was so confused she seemed to see it on my face; \"think about it for a minute, just calm down and think, what do you want to do be it something now or something in the future.\" what did I want to do? there was the question that decided what would happen next, I wasn't being told to do something, I wasn't reacting to crazy things happening. that single fragile handhold of control that one thing that I could decide for myself brought me out of all the things swirling through my head and I could finally come up with an answer for her. \"I want to get stronger!\".  And that was how I started living with my master, the woman who would teach me to be a ninja like her. we lived alone in the forest where my mother died, and where I trained under my master for the last 13 years. I am now 19 about to turn twenty and my master says I have learned what I need to stay alive, I need to travel the world and gain experience if I want to keep growing."}]}

She obeys them without question in order to please the mechanical goddess, but by the word of the Colonel - high priest in the cult's compound - Spirit cannot pray to the Machine.  One day, however, Spirit's friend Klavdiya gives her a prayer card which the goddess is assured to answer.  Spirit uses the card, contritely asking direction only to learn that the leadership in the Machine cult has been filled with lies and deceit.  She begins filling the followers' heads with new interpretations of the Holy User's and Programmer's Manuals, making them suspicious of the Colonel and the other members of leadership.  In the meantime, she continues to fulfill her duties dismembering willing followers and designing cybernetic implants with which to replace them.   While performing her regular job, she happens across the designs for Klavdiya's cybernetic wings and discovers that the Colonel had approved an atrocious failure, likely as punishment for one of Spirit's own small mistakes.  She wants to rescue Klavdiya, but the Colonel throws her in the hot box to stop her, leaving her in until her joint lubricant changes phase and fails.  During her time in jail, the Colonel investigates and discovers her subversion against him, but the rumors have gained enough clout that he needs her in order to combat them.  He removes her from the hot box, declares her 'broken and mentally unstable,' and locks her in her room.   Joints stiff and body painful once she awakes from a period of inactivation, Spirit is still able to escape her room.  She immediately goes to Klavdiya to rescue her, but Klavdiya believes Spirit is broken and doesn't heed her warnings.  The Colonel arrives and arrests Spirit, then takes her to his office where he removes her skin to exchange the joint fluid.  Under pressure and pain, she agrees to do as he asks and tell the congregation that she'd been feeding them lies.   Her skin gone and her body overly sensitive and painful, Spirit again escapes her room, this time going to the forge where Klavdiya's wings are almost complete.  She kills the smith who made the wings and destroys the originals, throwing both into the Machine's blazing forge to burn and melt down.  The next morning, the Colonel brings her in to admit her mistakes to the congregation, but he won't stop at that.  He takes her to the Machine for judgment, but Spirit uses the Machine's logic and announcements to turn the onlooking crowd against him.  She convinces the crowd to turn against the cult leadership, then flays a Lieutenant alive to take a replacement skin.  As the entire compound dives into chaos, Spirit makes her way to finally pull Klavdiya out of the compound.  They ride off into the sunset, satisfied that they will be the last believers of the Machine cult. "}]}

Arryn is a human cleric."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " There is despair, and then there is despair.  I find myself chained to a wall in a rank cave, surrounded by stolen goods and goblins.  How did I come to this low state?  I was traveling with a group of pilgrims to the Keep on the Borderlands to pay tribute at the Temple of St Cuthbert of the mace.  I was to then spend some time there preaching to the outlying villages and taking on tasks as needed. We were overrun on the road by a gang of goblins; mean little humanoids of an evil and spiteful nature.  We were brought into some caves that dotted the walls of a ravine set back from the main road.  The goblins talked long and hard about what to do with us.  They didn’t know that I understand their greasy tongue, and I didn’t let on that I did.  We were sorted, and the last I saw of the pilgrims was when some thuggish hobgoblins came and took them away.  They were traded for gold, most likely; sold into slavery. I failed them as a protector.  St. Cuthbert have mercy on them.   The reason I have been spared that fate is that the goblins intend to ransom me to the Temple at the Keep.  They have decided I would fetch a much higher price than what the hobgoblins would pay.  Stripped of my gear, they add insult to injury by putting it close at hand.  The goblins took my underclothes leaving me as vulnerable as a babe.   They would torment me, poking me with sticks.  Some of the more daring ones would touch me with their greasy claws, pinching and prodding.  They never violated me.  The chief would yell at and beat the others, telling them that if they abused me too much the Temple would never pay, and would send a troop of clerics and soldiers to come rescue me.  Their fear of retribution saved me from the worst of their attentions.  These degradations sorely tested my resolve. My Faith never waivered.  When the chief sent an emissary to the Keep to negotiate my release I even extended my prayers to it in the hope that the transaction would be speedy and fruitful.  He never returned.  I still believed.  Obviously that avenue of respite was not to be.  My trial must be a lesson St. Cuthbert needs me to learn. My conditions were squalid.   I was forced to live, eat and sleep in my own filth.  Every so often the goblins would take me away and douse me with freezing water, scrubbing me with stiff bristled brooms.  Even they could not stand the stench as my area would be cleaned and fresh straw lain down. On the last washing I grabbed a piece of cloth that was hanging out of one of the crates and wrapped it around me.  A goblin tried to take it and I hit him so hard I nearly killed him.  They let me have the cloth.  A small victory. After that incident they treated me with a modicum of respect.  It seems violence runs their social system.  I should have figured that out earlier.  Silly me!  They would take me for short walks in order to stretch my legs and preserve my figure.  They didn’t want me to look too wasted when the Temple came for me.  I have a pretty good sense of time, even when I can’t see the sun.  By my reckoning it has been a few days over a month I have been in captivity.  I begin to worry that if the Temple does not send word I will be the scapegoat for the goblin’s wrath.  I do not fear death if I had a chance to fight back, but I know these evil little monsters would use and abuse this vessel of St. Cuthbert before they finished me.  After this they would probably sell me to the hobgoblins in order to squeeze the most from me.  I do not relish this prospect and pray fervently for release. There was a large well kept door that the hobgoblins use to enter the goblin caves, and through which they would come and steal from the goblin’s loot that was stored here.  They would stop and leer and whisper lewd comments, but they never touched me.   The goblins would come and be baffled by their losses, looking to me as if I had committed the robbery.  I laughed at their stupidity.  I think the Chief is beginning to realize I speak their tongue.  His common is passable and he would interrogate me about the robberies but I only told him it was St. Cuthbert punishing them for their evil ways. On the eleventh day of my second month of captivity things changed.  The goblins had been restless, riled up like a nest of bees but today they were absolutely rabid.  They were rushing about, shouting about invaders.  Then all was quiet.  No one came with my gruel.   On the twelfth day of my second month of captivity I heard something approaching.  I waited, with some worry I will admit.  My prayers were answered!!  It was a group of adventurers!  They quickly freed me and I donned my gear.  They were respectful and turned away when I dropped my cloth.   When they saw my holy symbol they looked relieved, though they did comment that their last cleric was a female.  This worried me.  They all looked as if they had seen combat, so I laid hands on the dwarf, giving him the blessing of St. Cuthbert.  There was also a human who needed attention so I blessed him as well. None too soon the door opened and four hobgoblins were coming through.  The group sprang into action and the battle was joined!   It was a blur, blows being traded back and forth.  The hobgoblins were able fighters, I will grant them that.  I tried to help, firing my crossbow at the hobgoblins but the action was too furious for me to get a clear shot.   The fight raged, and two of the hobgoblins were down but one ran away.  The remaining hobgoblin hit the monk a serious blow and he fell.  Invoking the might of St. Cuthbert I smote the hobgoblin in the head with my mace, dashing out his brains.  I felt good, some small vengeance having been visited upon the foul creatures. We ran pell mell through the halls, encountering more hobgoblins and fighting our way through.  We ended up in a cave, hobgoblins pelting us with heavy crossbow bolts while their companions tried to cut us down.  Horatio went down in the melee, but I called upon St. Cuthbert to spare him from death.  We recovered the adventurers’ mule and loaded it with Horatio and a goblin that they had captured.  We fled the caves, making for the tree line across the ravine.  Again the hobgoblins rained crossbow bolts upon us.  The tiefling blasted one from existence, but they still brought down the monk.  Three of us carted him to the mule where again I called upon the benevolence of St. Cuthbert to spare him from dying. The journey to the Keep began in earnest.  It was midday when we left the valley so the goblinoids wouldn’t follow, and when night fell it found us quite some distance to the Keep.  It was decided to travel through the night; we could rest when we reached the Keep.  Morning came and the Keep came into view.  Midmorning found us at our destination.  The adventurers turned their captive over to the guards, and I made my way to the Temple.  They were glad to see me, and I was glad for a hot bath and freshly washed clothes.  The head priest fed me and explained the goblin emissary never reached the Keep.  He must have been killed upon the road. Freshly washed and smelling pretty, I found my new friends at the tavern.  They gave me some money, claiming I had taken part in the adventure.  I refused a portion, stating that I was not a part of their group at that point and thus did not deserve it.  I donated a large amount of my new wealth to the Temple. There were rumors abounding about bandits and the valley.  While at the Temple ministering to the needy I was given some information.  A sell sword told me that he had heard there were bugbears in the caves, and that they were afraid of dwarves.  I found this information to be most helpful.  We had a dwarf!  A weapon against the forces of evil!  It was truly a blessing from St. Cuthbert.  I told some of the others when I saw them.  Then it was provisioning and off to the valley again. We stopped at the Tor, a large hill that I recall passing during our flight to the Keep.  Camp was set up on top and we arranged for watches.  I drew the middle of the night.  As Fate would have it during watch we heard a loud whooshing, as if something large were flapping its wings.  The dwarf began waking the party and I got a look at what was coming.  It was huge.  Majestic.  Body of a horse and head of an eagle; a Hippogriff!  I was stunned.   Unfortunately, the suddenness of its appearance and the time of night caused my companions to react out of habit.  The monk struck fiercely but Tor Eastblade dealt horrific damage with his halberd, striking with both blade and haft.  The beast went down.  I cried out, and then began to weep openly for the loss of such a beautiful animal.  The tiefling cried out to heal it, so I called upon St. Cuthbert and was able to stop it’s descent into death.  Then I let the power of my God flow through me, healing the animal.  I sat there, stroking its magnificent head and whispering.  It began to make some purring cooing noises and then its eyes snapped open.  There was a long moment when our eyes met.  I continued to stroke it.  It was softer than it looked.  I continued to coo reassuringly to it.  It stood suddenly, startling me.  The group was looking on with caution.  I stood and continued to whisper and coo to it.  It glared balefully at the monk and Tor, and took a step forward.  I was facing it and it was now pressing hard against me.  I wrapped my arms around its neck and continued to pet it, then turned and scolded the two, using harsh words and shaking my finger at them.  This was a tense moment.  I continued to pet and whisper to it, gently pushing back.  It huffed though its nostrils and took a step back, shaking its head and looking down at me.  The Hippogriff then leapt into the air, its wings whooshing deeply as it rose into the night, finally disappearing into the darkness. I sat by the fire, too excited to sleep, and my mind wandered back to my childhood.  I remembered being filled with an energy, a restless energy that always had me moving.  I was a middle child of a large family, destined to be married off for the dowry.  I loved being outdoors.  I was given the chore of looking for berries, herbs and nuts and I loved being outdoors.  As the years went by I learned to hunt small game and fish, to skin and tan hides.  I began spending more time outdoors than indoors and that suited me just fine.  I didn’t dislike my family, I just liked being outdoors. The more time I spent in the woods, the more an arranged marriage became less appealing.  To have to marry someone I didn’t know and give up my life outdoors was unthinkable.  I didn’t want to become a brood mare for some farm boy.  Plus, I never really got along well with others.  People just made me nervous.   So I left.  I packed up my kit and left and went into the woods.  I left a note so my family wouldn’t worry.  I spent the better part of a year out alone in the woods when I discovered I really did like people.  Not all the time, but I did want some contact so I became a guide.  I travelled the woods, guiding hunting parties and trappers and pilgrims.  I learned so much, so many different languages.  You had to know a lot to get by.   I was guiding a party of pilgrims when my conversion happened.  We were attacked by a band of kobolds.  The little bastards were everywhere, swarming us like ants.  Something came over me, a strength and a feeling as if I couldn’t be hurt.  I waded into the gang of kobolds, swinging my mace like a scythe and cutting them down.  It felt like time slowed and I was able to change my strikes mid swing, staving in skulls and crushing ribs.  Then it was over.  The kobolds were all killed and the pilgrims only suffered minor wounds.  It was a miracle.  I looked at the banner that the pilgrims carried and it was St. Cuthbert of the Mace.  I followed them to the Temple and joined the Order. I loved the Order!  I was allowed to spend time alone, but also spend time with people.  I learned more things, more languages.  My combat training was formalized and I was able to tap into the Grace of St. Cuthbert which allowed me to do wondrous things.  I continued to guide for the Order, and was finally tasked to a smaller Temple out in the Borderlands.  And that is where my tale begins.  I sat, staring into the fire.  I watched the flames dance, and when the wind blew the coals flickered and glowed a whitish gray.  It hypnotized me, and I thought back again.  I thought about something that had vexed me for quite some time.  It was a vision I had had since I was a little girl.  In it I am standing near a fire, or a brazier.  Shadows are cast on cavern walls, dancing to the whim of the flames.  I am clothed in silken robes, with beautiful stitching of deepest blue.  My hands encircle my stomach, and I am great with child.  I have had this vision many times.  It is in part responsible for my flight from my family, but I had it when I was alone in the wilderness.  I had the vision when I was a guide, and even when I became a cleric of St. Cuthbert.   That puzzled me.  Why would I have a child while serving St. Cuthbert?  It made no sense to me.  But the vision was still there, frequent enough to give me pause and examine my life.  I was supposed to become pregnant.  Could it be St. Cuthbert calling to me all these years?  Was I supposed to raise a child in the Temple?  Questions I could not answer, and so left them to the flames.         "}]}

He always had a knack for illusion, growing much faster into his racial illusory traits than other Gnomish children. He would use these Minor Illusions to play tricks on his parents, the village elders, the other children, and any traveller that happened to be passing through. One of these travellers, the royal mage Darvin Shawl, noticed to Fern’s blooming talents and invited him to the royal academy in the Merralian capital of Seastead. Fern, eager to learn, packed up his bags and left the next day. At the academy, Fern’s raw ability started to become more refined, and his desire for mischief transformed into one for mystery. If he saw an open tome or an unsolved arcane formula, he would not rest until he solved it. His drive to truly test himself eventually clashed with the Academy's systematic style of learning and testing, so, anxious to keep moving forward and unaware of the dangers of the real world, Fern asked to take some time off so he could examine the nature of illusions outside of a controlled environment like the Academy.  Adventures with the Sparks The Sparks met in the classic way: sitting around a tavern table, hired to retrieve a certain artifact from a dungeon. Fern started out as aloof from the rest of the group, even actively disliking some. He didn’t get along particularly well with the criminal Romero, he was appalled by the fiendish pact made by Enna, he was shocked by the fiendish appearance of Kallista, and he didn’t care for the divine magic of Torinn. Over the course of the dungeon crawl, however, Fern became friends with the Sparks, becoming especially close with Enna.  Over the course of the next 8 years, the Sparks became stronger and closer, gaining recognition and reputation along the way They battled demons, devils, vampires, and beholders. They traveled to the Feywild and back (Romero and Kallista don’t remember that bit). They even faced down and slew an adult green dragon who was plotting to overthrow the King of Merral, Andor of House Paravage. They were thanked personally by the King, his wife Queen Luisa, and his daughter Princess Selise. About this time, Fern and Enna began to fall in love. However, the group was soon pulled separate ways, each with his or her own reason for leaving. Fern’s was the passing of his mentor Darvin.   Back at the Academy In a letter delivered after the funeral, Darvin urged Fern to carry on his work on the nature of the universe, determining the nature of illusion and reality, the difference between shadow matter and true matter, and whether or not their entire existence and universe was just an illusion, a simulated existence by some greater arcane being. So, Fern returned to the Academy and began researching. After years of research, both successful and not, Fern began to rise in the ranks of the mages, eventually becoming a right-hand advisor of the King. One day, King Andor received a dire message from Torrin, a warning of invasion from the Shadowfell. A massive portal had opened in the East, and the undead army of the Umbral Empire was marching into the Material Plane, spearheaded by the Death Cleric Emperor Vorrik and the Necromancer Empress Sylvia, both followers of the Ascended Lich Vecna.  The Final Preparation The Sparks reunited to face this monumental threat and were renamed by King Andor to the Guardians of the Hearth. They travelled across the land and even into some of the other planes to gather allies in their fight. Along the way, they met a Djinni who offered the five one wish each. The Sparks, not necessarily the wisest bunch of people, accepted. These five wishes would be twisted and turned against their makers, and they would eventually lead to Fern’s aversion to free-form Wish spells (none of the adverse effects of these wishes but Fern’s are noticed until later).   Romero, who had fallen in love with Princess Selise and had grown up in absolute poverty, wished to become a prince (think Aladdin); his wish was granted, and his history and family was rewritten to become the son of Vorrik and Sylvia, and heir to an empire of the dead. Kallista, whose diabolic appearance had been rebuked by all she met, wished to be loved and respected; the djinni placed a curse on her that compelled those around her to adore her unnaturally (creepily so). Enna wished that after the threat of the invasion was dealt with, the pact binding her to her fiendish patron would be broken. Torinn, righteous and focus, wished for a weapon that would help destroy followers of Vecna; he received the Sword of Kas and was eventually possessed by it, the dormant spirit of the Betrayer tearing apart his soul and seizing the body for his own. Fern, last to go and remembering his mentor’s dying wish, wished for the answer to a simple question: “Are we real?”. The sheer volume of knowledge from that answer destroyed his mind, killing him. Thankfully, Torinn cast Revivify and Kallista cast Modify Memory to erase the answer from his mind, but Fern is still haunted by images and experiences that he doesn’t understand.  The War of the Damned Fern, Enna, and Torinn (now Kas) met the Umbral army head-on in a battle just outside of the capital, leading their army of the living against the hoards of undead, while Romero and Kallista infiltrated the Shadowfell to locate the clones of the Emperor and Empress. After killing tides of zombies, skeletons, and shadows; undead giants; a shadow dragon; and a death tyrant; the three in the material plane eventually slew the leaders of the undead army, and the two in the Shadowfell destroyed the clones. At the battle’s end, when Fern confronted Torinn about his new Oathbreaker Paladin abilities and personality, Torinn revealed himself as Kas and killed the spell-spent Fern while the now-powerless Enna watched. He taunted the King, promising that he’d be back, and then teleported away using the Helm of Teleportation.  Aftermath Fern makes his way back to the kingdom after recuperating and resetting his clone. The remaining four Sparks are commended and thanked for their actions. They are then left to pursue their own courses of action over the next two years. Romero, now technically the Emperor of the Umbral empire, is left to deal with everything that the title brings and tries to set up good relations with the Kingdom of Merral and its Princess. Kallista goes off by herself, trying to find clues on the whereabouts of Kas and seeking comfort in isolation due to her curse. Enna sets up an adventurer’s guild in Merral, using her experience to guide the next generation of heroes. Fern returns to the Academy, perfecting his knowledge of the arcane to rise to the rank of Archmage. It’s the ceremony, everyone’s there, he’s walking up to center stage when . . .  "}]}

She remembers little of that night, besides fire and the lamentations of the dying. Her memories of her Tiefling life are hazy. She dimly remembers her mother’s face, the warmth of her arms, and scraps of stories.   She was taken to Faiontis on the island of Abaivoi, and sold to an ancient, skilled and highly respected Cnila-Barmoi warlock named Presbutermen of clan Trinepsios. He was brilliant, wholly devoted to uncovering demonic mysteries, and not much interested in Raptic politics or clan competition.   Aven was her Tiefling name. The warlock gave her the name Tibib to be used in his household, in the language of his people. Some in the household treated her kindly, some indifferently. Even Presbutermen was kind in his way. But his fondness for the girl did not prevent him in any way from using her for his dark ends.   To summon and bind a Demon, one must make an offering or a bargain. Offerings of pain and death are far safer than actual bargains. Demons can be as tricky as the Fey, and contracts with them easily result in catastrophe. Aven Tibib was subjected to unspeakable tortures. She was tattooed, bled and cut, as binding spells and the blood-thirst of Demons required. Her body is crisscrossed with scars, under layers of ritual tattoo.  She soon learned that escape without help was impossible. Her quick mind served her well, as she took in the ways of these strange people. And her strong spirit never broke. She observed Presbutermen keenly, at first simply to anticipate his moods and survive. Over time, as her intellect matured, she surreptitiously learned all she could about the dark arts, for she saw that such knowledge was the highest currency of the Raptics.   The household bound and used many Demons. The greatest of them was Piadph’Bab, bound centuries earlier by Presbutermen. The Demon was said to be one of the 9,099. It was, by far, the household’s greatest treasure and in no small measure accounted for their high status.   Presbutermen had one child, a son named Melomen, only a few years older than Tibib. He was turning out to be a disappointment to his father. The boy was kind and strong and happy, but not particularly clever. He showed little interest (and no aptitude) for pursuing his father’s studies.   Tibib and Melomen grew up and played together, becoming close. Some servants and family members tolerated it, but the pair had to be secretive around most of the household. Their love for each other was real, and as they began to mature, they fell in love—a state of affairs it was imperative to keep secret.   When Tibib became pregnant, they both panicked. As a virgin, she was especially useful to Presbutermen. Demons do love virgin’s pain after all. They feared the worst were he to find out. Surely, she and her unborn child would be sacrificed or worse. Melomen too risked death.   By this time, Tibib knew her way around a summoning circle and had mastered the most basic elements of demonology. Without Melomen’s knowledge, she struck a bargain with Piadph’Bab. Presbutermen had inscribed a sigil containing the Demon’s real name on the tanned skin of a Tiefling high priestess, given him by the Archmage Petroclaeus after the storming of Abaivoi. The sigil was the instrument of the Demon’s bondage.   Through deception, she used Melomen to gain access to the sigil. She then followed the Demon’s instructions as it led her through ritual incantations to free it from bondage to Presbutermen.   She cared not what havoc and revenge the Demon might wreak on the household. She deeply regretted leaving Melomen behind, and feared what might befall him. But the safety of her child was paramount. She knew her lover would not go along with un-binding the Demon, as that would have been the utmost betrayal of his father and clan.   Piadph’Bab honored its obligations and guided her to safety off the island. Hidden in a merchant vessel, she went to Dis, whereupon she tried her best to blend in as an ordinary Tiefling of Dis. Her scarification and tattoos rendered this difficult, as it did not take much knowledge of arcane arts to divine what she had been used for. Attracting too much attention for comfort, she soon took to hiding herself in cellars and drainage ditches, eventually to be found by a Nun of Kibeth who provided shelter in a convent.   Certain that Raptic pirates were on the hunt for her recapture, Aven’s overriding priority was to leave Dis as soon as possible, and to seek safety somewhere inland far from seas she imagined to be swarming with Elves.     Aven is fanatically devoted to the baby and will place its survival above all others, including theoretically her own, were such a choice necessary. She would see the whole world burn if it meant survival for the child. She is also strongly motivated by revenge against Presbutermen and the Raptics as a whole, but fears a return to their lands.   She endeavors to honor debts and obligations, and is willing to reciprocate loyalty. But she is slow to trust, and there is no trust she would not break to keep herself and the baby alive. No person, however good or dear, she would not harm or betray, if necessary. The honor, respect and fondness she feels for others is genuine… once earned. However, she is reflexively distrustful and secretive.   The opinions of others matter little to her in the grand scheme of things, beyond the practical advantages to how one is perceived. That is, she does not base her feelings about herself on those of others. To appear, for example, dishonorable to others would be of little emotional consequence to her.     Piadph’Bab  Like all Demons, there is not an iota of mercy, compassion or fondness in Piadph’Bab. Regard and respect… sure. Being Lawful, it is scrupulous in its agreements and contracts, and unforgiving with others in demanding that which they promise. Were it a Chaotic Demon, it could not have served as long or well for the clan. It was a being they could compel to serve, with ongoing vigilance, but without continuous struggle merely to contain it-- a reliable (though unwilling) servant, rather than a caged beast.   It loathes Presbutermen and surely seeks vengeance before returning to the Void. But it acknowledges and respects the warlock’s power, especially the skill required to deprive it of freedom for so long.   For reasons beyond Aven’s understanding, Piadph’Bab is not yet free to depart the Firmament.    A mishmash of Greek, Enochian and Hebrew and their meanings:  Aven Tibib-- wickedness, sorrowful Piadph'Bab-- in the jaws of possibility  Presbutermen-- the elder moon Melomen-- music of the moons  Trinepsios—three cousins Petroclaeus-- the stone that is broken"}]}

He is a human fighter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is the backstory of two brothers. Aquilonian by nation of birth, but by upbringing and bloodline, they are as much Gundermen and Brythunian as they are Aquilonian.  They grew up in a rural village in the north of Aquilonia, under the rule of Lord Haestius. His lands were close enough to Cimmeria to be within range of the occasional raid, but far enough south of the border to not have to live in a constant state of alert. Haestius was felt to be a good lord by his subjects, not unduly taking advantage of his title and complete control over the fiefdom.  His landholdings were not large, comprising a couple small villages and numerous outlying homesteads. The dominant bloodline of the inhabitants was Aquilonian (Haestius’s line was purported to be as “pure” as such things can be), though many had over time mixed blood with Gundermen, and to a lesser extent mixed by force with Cimmerians and the savages of the Border Kingdoms.  One villager in particular stood out ethnically from the others-- a Gunderman iron smith named Eilulf, who had come to the village many years before as a young man, alone and without resources, but already sufficiently skilled in his craft to surpass any other smith in the land. In short order he became well-established and respected in the community, and as wealthy as a craftsman in the village could become according to his station.  Eilulf was a powerful, stocky man with gloomy grey eyes. He was prone to bouts of moodiness, as well as of furious productivity. He was brave, strong and level-headed and earned a spot as a village Elder despite not having historic blood ties to the land. For years, he lived and worked alone, until one day a beautiful bride, the likes of which no one had ever beheld arrived for him.  No one ever figured out how Eilulf managed to wed an elegant beauty like Raeburn. It was said she came from Brythunia, and she arrived mysteriously at the village at dawn without entourage. It was a wonder that such as she could have made safe passage alone without becoming someone’s concubine across a few leagues journey, let alone the hundreds she would have had to cross from Brythunia. Her dark features, huge saucer-like brown eyes and alien raiment were certainly not native. She could not have been a slave delivered, as she was, alone, nor did she have the broken manner of a slave or a used woman. She was not a woman to be bought or sold, and the villagers soon found her to exhibit a fierce independence and will that seemed to match that of Eilulf.  Raeburn more or less adapted to the lifestyle, clothing, etc. of rural Aquilonians, with some notable exceptions. Out of the house she wore the long coverings befitting a peasant Aqualonian woman. Occasionally a passerby might catch a glimpse of her through a window, scantily and exotically dressed like women of the far east, and draped luxuriously like a cat in Eilulf’s home. Many in the land were envious of his domestic bounty.  Raeburn was also exceptional in that she could read quite well and write a bit too. Eilulf was one of the only Elders who could read even a little bit, and he could do no more writing than make his mark. Raeburn was the only truly literate person for some distance, other than Lord Haestius himself. The two would sometimes converse, almost as equals, and they took pleasure in the company of another who had some familiarity with genuine refinement.  Eilulf and Raeburn lived happily and with passion, but she never conceived, even after many years. As time passed Raeburn increasingly felt the pull of motherhood. It was unthinkable that she could have been anything other than sublimely fecund, and the couple naturally came to wonder whether Eilulf was incapable of planting his seed in her. [He had had a bout of mumps as an adult, leaving him sterile.]  After much consideration Raeburn begged Eilulf to permit her to lay with Haestius, as the only other man around she would bear to have touch her. He initially responded with hurt and anger, but over time and with much pleading Eilulf submitted to her will. He was ultimately unwilling to deny her so essential a desire.  So Raeburn lay with Haestius and conceived a son, whom she named Beatian. Not in spite did she give their son an Aquilonean name, nor did she ever blame him for his inability to plant seed. Her devotion and affection for her husband only increased with motherhood. Eilulf did wonder though if she had lost some respect for him as a man, and whether (over his objections) she had named the boy by the blood of the father to make some kind of point. At first he insisted the boy at least be called Beatian son of Eilulf after the fashion of a Gunderman, but over time that ceased to be a point of redemption and instead came to feel like a mockery and the son became known simply as Beatian.  After conceiving, Raeburn curtailed her friendship with Haestius, though from time to time they came together. He, in turn, made himself busy elsewhere for he had come to love her and it pained him to have her belong to another. He sometimes considered eliminating Eilulf and taking her as his own, as was certainly in his material power to do.  But, he was basically a good man, and he also knew she would never forgive such an act. Instead he ever after found himself patrolling the borders of his land or otherwise drawn away for long periods from his manor. Two years later, she conceived a second and final child by him, a boy who she named Credian.  Eilulf was devoted to his sons and loved them dearly. He could not bring himself to become too close to them however and there was always a distance between them. He was stern and quite harsh with them at times, especially when they disappointed or failed to live up to their duties and his expectations of excellence. They seemed not to notice their father’s distance however, and exhibited the confident and easy-going manner of their mother even from a young age. They grew up to be quick-witted and bright, and most competent at that which was of interest to them. They were powerfully built and stocky, with grey Hyborian eyes and the dark complexion of their mother.  Beatian’s interests mirrored his mother’s in most respects.  He learned to read and make letters early. He deflected with ease his father’s attempts to teach him smithing and warcraft. Instead he took a keen (but objective and personally uninvolved) interest in people and in nature, and went through life seemingly unconcerned with the social order or opinions of others.  For Credian’s part, he was more his father’s son and learned some of Eilulf’s craft. Credian was more boyish and tougher than his older brother, and quicker to anger. He often compensated for his brother’s carelessness and naiveté, extracting them frequently from close scrapes with danger.  The boys had little contact with Haestius beyond that which naturally occurred in the village between lord and subject. Haestius would have seen they were well provided for, but that was unnecessary as Eilulf could supply all they required. In time though when the boys came of age, Haestius surreptitiously used his influence on their behalf-- first to pave the way for Beatian to study and apprentice with scholars in Tarentia, and then to place Credian as a Captain’s runner in a heavy foot company.  Beatian loved the city, with all its amusements and energy. He did not dive into the lifeblood of the city, instead preferring to observe and soak it all in. He studied letters further and stole into libraries as often as he could. In time, he came across a Stygian sorcerer and became deeply infatuated with the arcane. The Stygian was a cruel master and treated his students terribly but Beatian weathered the abuse with apparent unconcern. He slept little, devoting all his time to his studies and to walks in the busiest bazaars and quarters of the city at all times of day and night.  His family did not hear from him much in these years, nor did he travel back home. His mother received a letter once or twice a year. She would joyously read her son’s excited and witty descriptions of city life to her husband, who would frown in disapproval at the impracticality of book learning, though he secretly admired his son’s fearlessness and independence.  Then they stopped receiving letters. A year went by without any reply to their inquiries.  Then two years. Eilulf traveled to the capital after three years had elapsed, only to hear from the Stygian that his student had disappeared one day and hadn’t been seen since."}]}

Tribe Thuliaga was a small tribe of Goliath, eking out a lonely existence in The Iron-Wyrm Peaks (translated into Common from Giant), with at most 35 members, mainly the descendants of an ancient and heroic and Goliath warlord. There had not been a new child born in 13 years – Aukan and his twin sister, Vaunea were a glimmer of hope. Aukan’s mother died in childbirth. Aukan was a dutiful child, working hard to support his tribe as best he could. As a nimble youth he scouted and snuck, hunting for food. At the tender age of 12 he killed a bear whilst hunting alone in the lowlands, earning the nickname of “Bearkiller” from his chieftain. Vaunea however broke under the pressure, as much as a goliath can at least. Vaunea left the tribe at the age of 15, running away during the tribes visit to a low-land temple-town to trade. The chieftain declared her exiled and forbade mention of her name. She was the second death Aukan knew.  Over the next 12 years Aukan’s tribe died around him. Hunts went poorly, and starvation begun to set in. Disease took the old. His father died in an avalanche. Some tribesmen went off to seek glorious death and found it. Others died in odd accidents – bridges breaking, cliffs collapsing.

She begged Aukan to come, to remove the dishonour his sister had brought. Aukan remained. And then there was one. The last of his tribe, Aukan went to the lowlands seeking his long lost sister. Instead he found a strange land with strange customs. Aukan learnt the common tongue from a dwarf clan, and set out into the world to find himself, and bring honour to his tribe.

Roaming the planes, putting fiends in their place, doing crazy magic experiments. But he was born the son of nameless dirt farmers in a forgotten corner of the world. He lived his dreary life day by day, until one of those days when he was still very young, an old man came to his home seeking shelter. He was welcomed in, and offered a place to sleep. Come morning, the young Wizlor (birth name unknown) found the man dead where he slept, and found something in the old man's possessions: a strange book.  At first he thought it the ramblings of a madman, or perhaps a coded journal, but with nothing else to do and an inquiring mind, he set himself to uncover the secrets of this tome. After whatever time of studying, he finally deciphered some of the runes and scribbles, tirelessly working to reverse engineer the process that laid them down on the page.   Muttering the old words and miming the gestures to no effect for hours, he almost lost hope when, in the wee hours of the night, a spark flung from his fingertips. This spark ignited another in the boy, and he took even more feverishly to his studies. Perhaps too much so, because he was soon caught in the act by his parents. Accused of devilry, he was cast from his home and set on a long journey that would take him farther than he could ever imagine.  His journey learning magic is largely unparticulared, but on the way, I assure you, many zany things happened. I want to flesh this part out but haven't yet. At some point he was discovered by the man who would become his mentor. Or perhaps he already was, for this man was the sage Alcaran, Archmage of Time and the only practitioner of chronomancy known to the world. After some no doubt impressive stunt, Alcaran took Wizlor (who had likely taken that name on by that point) to the wizard nation of Are Lyvinzia. Almost entirely populated by wizards, and warded from outside detection and invasion by uncountable wards, Are Lyvinzia was a mage's paradise.   There, Wizlor enrolled in the Academa Vinificta, where wizards of all schools toiled to further the arcane science, and where many wacky things happened. He met his roommate Yeran, the grumpy scholar with a penchant for excessive sexual experimentation, took part in many goofy pranks, and also important school stuff. And let's not forget the names. Ever since he had taken off to see the world Wizlor had been adding titles and names to his own. He was maybe a little self-absorbed.  Then, after perhaps 20 years spent in Are Lyvinzia, something happened that was not in the slightest goofy or zany. Archmage Alcaran disappeared, along with his tower. Nobody knew exactly how or why, but they figured it had to do with his studies. Alcaran was known to appear and reappear in multiple occasions at varying ages. Chronomancy is an inherently unstable practice, it turns out. He was said to have been working on something especially risky when he disappeared, but what exactly isn't known  Distraught at his mentor's disappearance, Wizlor almost immediately set out to find him, and so began his second sojourn. He searched for a long, long, long time, had so many adventures along the way, enough for multiple lifetimes. But no matter all the friends and enemies he made, all the people saved or ruined, he could never find the man who made him who he was. Only once was Alcaran ever spotted, in the desert land of Salkhoro, by another Archmage.  Eventually, even Wizlor gave up hope of finding him. He found meaning in his life through his own adventures. He grew to be a powerful wizard in his own right. Roaming the planes for new sights, righting cosmic wrongs, when he came into contact with a Pit Fiend by the name of Guziel. Wizlor thought this just another villain to vanquish, cocky he had become. But as Wizlor thought he had the upper hand, that he had tricked the fiend, Guziel pulled the rug out from under him. He struck the wizard down, and stole everything from him. His spellbook, his names, his powers. Wizlor was left wandering, aimless, trying to figure out what had gone wrong.  Some time after he had regained a measure of power, he joined forces with Die Arschloch (the party) to stop the Dead God Izhothu's shards from being brought together and ending the world. A quest more closely tied to him than he could have thought, he would soon find out, when Alcaran appeared to him, seemingly having found a way to temporarily return to this world or timeline."}]}

Who could spread a lie quicker than the flames of Neverwinter’s volcanoes, and unveil the truth truer than any scholar known to man. Who could break a heart with the trailing of music off and away, or mend it with poems of bittersweet elegance and romantic rhymes reviving. Who could tell stories that would make a strong man cry, and cure sorrow with a celestial smile of white. This was a bard with knowledge of the stars and the skies. The trees and the plants. The poor and the rich. The locked and the free. A bard who knew the secrets of metals and stones, of oceans and seas. Who could unleash the might of thunder and channel the powers of fire. Who could summon the wind by name and conjure up celestial lights. An arcane musician whose notes echoes a cross the ethereal. Quill Spellsong was his name, and it is a name highly known around the forgotten realms. Famous and infamous. He had patrons among the wealthy, and hosts among kings. He had lovers and admirers, fans, and friends. His knowledge unbounding, there wasn’t a university that hadn’t hosted his habits. But he also had enemies among nobles he satirized, and kings he threatened. He had infuriated professors, angered scholars, and insulted musicians with his quick wit and silver tongue.  For these people, Quill was a bard of renown, and the only person known to ever successfully perform the entirety of more than a few difficult songs. He was the man they feared and the man they craved. However, Quill had a history unwritten in his lore. A history of death, bloodshed, and sorrow. A broken heart and an injured pride. But that aside…  Koten Panati was raised a farmer.  She helped around here and there, while always studying her music on the side. She had a simple and innocent life. At the age of 12, she discovered something that would change that life. The fact that this wasn’t her first. While the Panati was visiting the shores and caves nearby to their farm, celebrating the farm’s success that year and the money they had acquired, Koten, always the curious girl, delved deep and deeper into the shoreline caverns. Her parents and siblings lost in the moment, did not notice her slip off into the damp darkness. Within the caves, Panati bravely trekked further into the looming darkness, playing her lute all the while. She played mindlessly as she wandered, until she tripped over something sticking out of the ground. It was a lute case buried in the moist dirt. For a long time it had been forgotten, lost, and neglected. Unzipping the case, Panati found herself holding a shabby lute… but one that had been cared for into a state of magnificence. Just gazing upon it, she could feel the heart and soul that had been imparted into the lute. Perhaps, because it called her. It resonated within her. Feeling the lute, she knew it had been carefully cared for, delicately treated like a fragile flower. When her hands glazed along the  strings – the only fancy piece of the simple instrument was one singular mithral string in the middle of the seven total – she could hear the songs it once played without every plucking a note. Setting her lute aside, she held the mithral-stringed lute in her hands, her spirit growing in confidence. Something inside of her struggled to get free. An irresistible desire to connect with the instrument. And so she did. She played until she drifted out of focus and of consciousness into a dissonant sleep.  Memories flashed through her mind. Memories of a past life. Of past love. The lute in her hands. The music it played. Her DEATH. Koten opened her eyes and plucked the final notes of the ethereal tune, a song she had never known before – in this life at least. Koten opened her eyes, different than she once was. For now she remembered who she was and would be again. Quill Spellsong. Something within the deeper tunnels trembled and tremored. An ethereal light from deeper still came to vision and slowly crept its way closer. There were shadows of horrid elder creatures emerging from shadows below. Koten, on instinct, fled the caverns as soon as the void beasts piled out of the darkness like terrifying scarabs and roaches. Chasing her out of the tunnels, an ethereal and dissonant song followed her wherever she went. The music rattling in her head like a taunting attack. It was not the music of Quill Spellsong or herself or any other bard she knew. It was the song she had played instinctively on the mithral-string lute. The lute still in her hands. As she gazed upon its abandoned condition, and the singular shiny string of mithral, she noticed arcana sparking off the strings like lightning. The strings acting as conducts to the electricity of the musician’s touch.   Distracted, she tripped over a stone. Ahead, the light of the setting sun. So close, but yet so far. The voidlings drew closer. Swarmed towards her. She wanted to cower in a corner and hide like the little girl she was. Hide behind her valiant father, in her mother’s caring arms. She wanted to be anywhere but here. Luckily for Koten, she wasn’t alone in her mind. The instincts of her past life pushing through, her fingers began to strike chords. The pace of the music increasing in parallel to her rushing heartbeat. The voidlings drew closer, the music more intense. One of the disfigured elder beasts lunged forward, and she struck the final note, her fingers now laced in the arcing arcana energy. A wave of thunder washed from the lute extending into the dark caverns below. The voidlings were blown back and stunned. Some were even killed by the electric discharge of the blast. Bravery kicking in, she thrust to her feet and dashed out of the caves as they collapsed behind her from the thunderous wave. Emerging to the shoreline, she found it burning. Her parents’ corpses strewn about and viciously torn. Partially eaten by some ferocious beast. Scattering away from the bloody scene, were void beasts slipping into shadows and crevices in the rocky wall behind and around her. In shock, Koten stayed there for hours. Playing sorrow goodbyes on her new lute, her old one lost forever in the shadows. Returning to her family’s farm, hoping to grab things of value before hitting the road, she stumbled upon a group of mercenaries smashing apart the building, seeking for someone and something. She need not know any more. She heard the words pass their lips. “What are we still doing here? Do you really think we’re going to stumble upon Quill Spellsong on a peasant’s farm?” “Don’t forget the girl. What was her name? Cotton?” “Koten. The little Panati girl.” “We find her, we find Quill, and we find what we’ve been paid to find. They’ll probably come back shortly. It’s getting late. We’ll be here when they do.” Koten ran away, her mind melding with that of Quills. Logic persisting, knowledge returning, and wisdom flowing. Koten knew what she needed to do. What songs she needed to play. What notes would ring truths and lies and guide her where she need go. What masks she would need to wear. Koten joined the first caravan she came across, playing music for the merchants and travelers every night in exchange for a ride. She adopted the name Quote Silverfond, and with it, she spent three years chasing down secrets of her past life, her new life, and the ethereal song of the void.  In her first town, Quote was stricken poor. She had no money. No food or water. She played as an entertainer at a local inn for many tenday. But there came a time when people began to ask too many questions, and throw too many curious eyes her way. Quote embarked on a trip to Phandelin, hoping to have better luck in that small but growing town.  Upon arriving, she was quickly dissuaded from her choice of stay. Her face tenday there, someone was murdered. Shortly following that, these gigantic beasts of the ocean fell from the sky and crushed the mayor’s manor house. Many crazy things happened in Phandelin, and she decided it best to move on to Luskan. Besides, there was too much competition there already between a lute bard like herself and a short gnome with chocolates and a recorder. The gnome was surprisingly good, and only unleashing her true potential as Quill could she best him. Now was not the time to reveal her identity. In Luskan, the rebuilding port city, Quote managed to live a poor musician’s life. The history of Luskan rich in the arcane, she attempted to seek knowledge in the few libraries remaining from before that Lich blew up half the town. Rebuilding her skills, Quote could enthrall an audience and put them to sleep with arcane lullabies. Sharpening her tongue, Quote’s wit could diffuse intense bar fights, lift moods, and allure money from nobles and patrons. By the time she turned 14, the mercenaries finally caught up to her. Confronting her in an alley, they pulled knives on her. They wanted to know where Quill Spellsong was. They didn’t know that she was Quill Spellsong. Good, she thought; they’ll underestimate my capabilities. Grabbing her lute, Quote let the spirit and mind of Quill Spellsong take control. Striking her chords, and channeling her arcana, Quote unleashed chords of thunder at her enemies. The streets of Luskan shook under her power. Disarming a thug, Quote took his dagger and stabbed at one of the others. Soon, all the mercenaries lay dead before her. Bleeding out of her leg, for she had been cut during the fight, Quote looted the corpses for daggers and gold. Knowing there would be more, she patched herself up roughly; she’d have a limp for a few days, but the scar would heal. Quote purchased armor, for if someone was truly trying to kill her, she’d need it.  Wearing her leather and cloak, lute strapped around her back, Quote set forth back to Neverwinter, the city that loomed over her family’s farm. There she would seek real answers. In the colleges of Neverwinter, the streets, and the inns, Quote would begin her journey. (At this point, Quote has remembered the talents she once had, and must reconnect with. She remembers vaguely the songs and plays she had performed to wondrous appeal. Slowly these memories return as she performs. Quote knows that she was Quill and Koten before. She remembers dying in a burst of ethereal light. She remembers that the basics of the knowledge she once held as Quill. Perhaps most importantly, she remembers the lute in her hands and holds brief flashes of pleasing memories, the story of the Mithral String. The lute was all Quill could afford, and its nostalgia remained with him even when he could have purchased another instrument far more beautiful. Instead he spent his money on a set of silver strings for the lute of his lover, Destiny Fatespeaker. All Quote remembers of her is the love she felt towards Destiny. She cannot remember her face, touch, or smell. The sound of her voice or instrument. Only the purest feelings of the heart. And the fact that of the seven strings of mithral Quill “wasted” her lifes savings on and thus gifted to her lover, Destiny had only taken six. One of the seven strings was the middle string laced between Quotes lute. The ethereal song that Koten had played in the caverns continues to taunt her. Its dissonant terror a mocking call of the void.) "}]}

Include the following information: his name, class, and race."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My story begins the way it usually does: Following the trail of blood to dash out the wounded animal at the end. The other hunters were off checking in their own directions. They couldn't read their prey like I could. But it helped that I knew Bugdal. He was 19 years old, surely having the physique of a man at this point but without the experience to consider important details of his actions like the gorge half a mile in front of him. Then I hear a loud splash about 20 yards in front of me. My prey is near. Running across branches I catch up close enough to see his maniked form clutching his wounded side and clawing to get as much ground as he could. I jump down toward him and spring off his his soldiers, enforcing a strong face plant. When fighting an orc, it’s always important to go for a hard knock to the head first. An orc with a concussion is far more pleasant than an angry orc. Knowing your prey is the difference between victory and defeat. Bugdal drags himself up and swivels his head around to look at his attacker. A certain spark lights in his eyes and in an instant I was no longer looking at a wounded soldier but instead at a full-size tiger. He’s a Druid! With the high density of our wood elf captors in the region nature never chooses an orc as its champion. Suddenly his actions seem significantly more brave as the tree-huggers would have slashed his throat simply for having innate magic capabilities. Selective breeding I suppose. I grip my machete in my right arm as my left slowly reached for the wooden pike strapped to my back. All at once the large cat sprang forward with its wide set of teeth and claws on full display. I quickly respond by ripping the spear loose from its harness and directing it toward the oncoming predator. The spear’s end connects with the beast’s sternum. Using all my strength I swing it over me and pin it to the ground. The hunt was over. The tiger howled in pain as it made vain attempts to escape my weapon’s grasp. While it struggled their I began to admire the beast. The proud orange fur that announced it’s presence with vigor, the powerful claws used to chase its prey and easily finish it, and its absolute yellow eyes that would never blink in the face of its enemies. Eventually Bugdal stopped struggling and I stepped forward and placed my blade against his neck. Without moving his head he simply looked up at me with his fluorescent eyes. Not with anger. Not with hate. Not with feat. But with sorrow. The sorrow of a boy whom was not allowed to live. I closed my eyes and quickly pulled the knife. I looked down at myself. The cut must have spurted because my leather armor was soaked in blood. Orc blood. This was perverse. How could I allow myself to slaughter my brethren while my worst enemies loomed above me laughing? In that moment something lit in me that I had never known before.  I returned to the encampment with the polymorphed form slung over my shoulder a few hours later. Waiting for me on the edge of the camp was the elven ranger commander Rinlor and at least a dozen of the encampment soldiers waiting with bows. Here the four other orc rangers were waiting for me to return while, as the rules dictate, holding heavy crates above their heads until their last member returned. I stop about 20 yards in front of the group. Rinlor sneered. “Decided to skip the mission to go big game hunting, have we? Ona ta a'amin”. I don’t speak Elvish but I’ve seen enough orcs make mistakes before to know what it meant. At once another leaf licker stepped out from the tent leading an orc woman by her leash and shackles. The woman that taught me everything I know today. One of the only orcs capable of showing more technique and skill than any elf on camp. The only leverage that the elves have over me. My mother. The elf knocked her to the ground in front of Rinlor. I said “He was a druid. He took this form then I killed him.” “What, you think I haven’t heard that story before? Come on, Morbash, at least try something new.” His eyes examined my mother in detail “Now, if memory serves the punishment for returning late is enduring two days in the chamber and with the lie you just told that’ll be a total of five days. But I’m in a good mood so I’ll go easy on you this time. Instead of staying in that hell hole I’ll let her reside in comfort of my own personal quarters.” The carcass fell at my side and my gaze was unbreakably fixed onto Rinlor. I gripped my knife.  “Oh struck a nerve have I?” He forces her to her feet with one hand and draws a knife that he keeps cleaner than even his silverware and held it up to her neck. My mother was getting older and was heavily bound so she didn’t even make an attempt to resist his actions. Shame was painted on her face. Shame that she was powerless now. Shame that her very life was such a burden on her son. Shame that this is the legacy as the greatest Orc ranger to date, her legacy, is living out her days either being tortured or waiting to be tortured. “Maybe next time you’ll actually catch the damned grey skinned bastar-”. SKKNT! All thirteen wood elves now stare in awe at the knife protruding from the woman’s chest. It was not the dainty blade that Rinlor held that ended my mother’s life. It was her own dagger that did it, a dagger that was passed down to me.   “Look! Over here, momma! I found a big furry snake stuck in a bear trap!” I called to my mother. She casually strode over and frowned when she saw what I was pointing at. “Damned daisy biters. Using cruel traps in place of real skill.” She got down low so as to look at her six year old son in the eye. “That’s not a snake, that’s a fox’s leg. When smart foxes get their leg stuck in a bear trap, they bite their leg off. Remember traps like these should be used on large animals only.”  I laugh from my belly. “Why don’t the foxes want their legs anymore, Momma?” She had already walked over to the trap and started deconstructing it. “You see if the fox had decided to keep its leg then after suffering for a few days the hunter would return and kill the fox, meaning that the fox would not only lose its leg, but the rest of it’s body too. Only the weak foxes wait for the hunter to return.” “Oh,” I stared at the pieces of the trap on the ground. “Here take this,” I looked up to my mother who was holding out one of the fox’s claws. “So you  never forget to be the smart fox.”   Now a 6 months have past since the incident back at the encampment. I’ve been living out of the jungle. I now wear the tiger’s tooth around my neck along with my fox’s claw. The elves want me for 1000 gold for the murder of thirteen elves and the destruction of property, namely my mother. I’ve put down two bounty hunters so far and I expect more. To the orcs I’ve become a symbol of revolution. They call me The Tiger. The elves continue to propagate my story as that of a lunatic to prevent further revolt, but the orcs know what really happened. My story's even began spreading to other encampments and mining colonies. Orc revolts have reached an all-time high and a few other select individuals have escaped and began looking for me to join my efforts against the elvish reign of terror. Eventually I will seek them out to free our people once and for all but for now I must gather intel and prepare myself to call for revolution."}]}

During the several weeks she lay there healing, she got to know the animals who lived in the forest, especially the baby bear who came by to lick her wounds. She also had many strange dreams about a goat faced god watching her. Eventually, she came to care for the animals she used to hunt and renounced her old ways to live in the forest.

Pickles was a god of nature, and when he deemed his followers were trained enough in the druidic arts, he sent them to the part of the forest that was in most need of healing. After several years with the Followers of Pickles, Ennis woke up in a strange part of the forest. Few animals lived there due to overhunting, and she used her skills to protect the animals that remained, by hiding them and scaring off poachers with her magic. Eventually, the legend in the local village grew that there was a witch who punished anyone who hurt her forest, and the overhunting stopped. Ennis still doesn't know exactly where she is, or if her work is done yet, so she stays close to the village to keep an eye on hunting parties and every once in a while, she sneaks into the village for a cheese platter.

However, due to his ancestors’ exorbitant spending habits combined with their lack of business sense and tact, their money had been dwindling even by the time he was born. He was an only child, and for the first few years of his life he was kept to a rigid schedule of education and magical training. This included reading on the subject of the family history, which has quite a bit on demons–it is said within the family that their fates were once entwined with that of a fiend, and may be again, so they all are to learn and prepare for that eventuality, though until recently he thought that was rubbish and never payed it much mind. After a particularly harsh year (when Benny was about eight), things changed. All of his parents’ coin and more was going to keeping up the appearance that they were still rich, so they couldn’t afford to continue his education, and they were always too busy to pay any attention to him. Except to reprimand him for taking too much food, or dirtying his clothes, or growing out of his old shoes, don’t you know these things cost money, Bentley!  Benny took to spending most of his time away from home, with other youngsters of his age, particularly those richer than him. Whenever possible, he subtly ensured that he was never the one paying for anything, and would even lie and steal from them–not that they missed a few dozen gold here and there. He used the coin to stockpile his own meals  (which he kept hidden from his parents lest they confiscate it or his hidden cash) and fund a wardrobe so his parents wouldn’t scold him for needing them to pay for it. He and his friends all took to playing cards together often, for real stakes, and he won often. He never told them about his family’s troubles, and he was good at cards–but the other children were trained for politics too, so he was never quite sure if they knew. The two he was with most often when not at home, elf twins Mason and Cecilia, Benny knew were better than him, and yet never quite seemed to come out victorious when Benny had a chance left. He wasn’t sure he minded.  As he got to be around eighteen, Benny’s parents started noticing him a little more. More specifically, they started noticing his marriage prospects. Ought a charming, handsome young lad like their Bentley not be able to find a good–by which they meant wealthy–wife? Against his wishes, they began arranging a wedding with a girl of around his age, Jane. Benny hated this idea. For one thing, he and Jane were acquainted, and not in a good way. But more importantly, it was the principle of the thing; why should he want to help his family out of their troubles, when they never cared about him? And of course, Benny already had a boyfriend, though he hadn't told his parents--Mason. This clarified for Benny what he had felt for a while: he had to leave. So he did. It wasn’t even hard–he often went days or weeks without really seeing his parents, they likely wouldn’t notice for some time if he just walked out. His friends would, though, so before he left he met with Mason and Cecilia one last time. They talked for a while, then embraced (Benny would later find one or the other of them had slipped a small pouch of gold and gems into his pocket, and a wooden ring that Mason, amateur woodcarver, had clearly hand-made with his initials, B.F., carved into it, and the twins would each find a playing card in theirs, as Benny had little else to give). After that point, he left his old life behind and started going by new names. Wolfgang was not his first, just his latest.  Wolfgang traveled the continent hiding his magic and acting as a con artist, mostly for the thrill of it once he had enough funds to get by, though his card-playing made it tough to keep a lot stocked up at any one time–his win rate was noticeably lower than when he played with his friends when he was younger. He took on jobs with no training to see if he could do them by cramming (with mixed success), but mostly kept to small cons so he wouldn’t draw too much attention. He keeps detailed notes on almost everything, written in Abyssal and transliterated into Elvish script, then encrypted with a keyed rotational cipher. The Empire arrived when he was 20, but he kept out of the fighting and it didn’t change his life particularly–lies are lies no matter who’s in charge. He wonders sometimes if his friends, and on particular days his parents, survived the war, but he hasn’t sought them out.  Recently, as he was posing as the invented persona Anrar Nidisc, refurbishment auditor at a library (which has since burnt down, not that Wolfgang knows that yet) and enjoying free access to ancient texts while waiting to see if they’d realize that refurbishment auditor isn’t a real position, he came across an old scroll written in Abyssal. It is mostly unreadable, but he was able to make out a few words clearly, including the name “Fensler”. After the initial shock of finding the name he hadn’t associated with in nearly four years, in a demonic script, essentially confirming the family stories he’d thought were nonsense, he asked about any texts related to this one. He was told that there were none there, but he might be able to find one in Northgate. After tying up the identity of Anrar so he could return as him later if necessary, he took the scroll (without asking) and set out."}]}

Include details about his upbringing, key events that shaped his character, and his motivations for becoming a Paladin."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Avi was orphaned on the steps of a temple, and so raised as an acolyte. However, the religion itself was never really his calling. He appreciated and learned about it, but (as half-elves are wont to do) only loosely associated with it. Still, he was surrounded by people with strong opinions of moral right and wrong, so despite his general ambivalence towards faith, he did end up with a perhaps idealized concept of and desire to do good. His adoptive father, Serge, was a former monk and adventurer from outside the city, so from a young age he taught Avi to fight and defend himself. It was, of course, more theoretical than actually going out and fighting things. Serge does feel rather fatherly towards Avi, but he’s also got a sort of tough-love approach: seeing that though Avi spent his free time reading and studying he wasn’t likely to become a religious professional, he essentially kicked Avi out of the temple and told him to go figure out what he is going to do with his life. Avi very much admires and respects Serge, but is also kind of terrified of him, since he has a gruff personality, so he dutifully went out into the city. He quickly decided that the best way he could help people and still earn some money for food (since he’s  doing his best to stay away from the temple in the hours Serge is awake, which is also the times when they serve food) is to work as a mercenary of sorts. He’s… not been doing too well at that, since he’s a very nervous kid, and not comfortable with charging people. One of his early customers was Ela Sade, an old woman from an Eshuetin district, who’s own son is a Kruzidier agitator too busy with politics to really care for her. Her son sends her money to make sure she can eat and not lose her home, but she doesn’t have any other income, and is only really connected to some of her neighbors who either don’t know that her son is infamous for causing trouble or don’t care. Avi, therefore, worries about her, and tries to help her out as much as possible. She thinks he’s a very nice young man…. Especially since her mode of paying him is usually to give him fresh bread or some of whatever food she’s cooking, and despite that he was raised with the privilege of an acolyte, he never complains. Not everyone who Avi runs into outside of the temple likes him so much, however. Shay, for example, is unimpressed by his regular appearance in the Eshuetin district. He’s a street kid, who sees Avi as an outsider who must have grown up pampered, with life in the temple. He gives Avi trouble whenever he sees him, harassing him verbally, stealing his bread—and Avi doesn’t know what to do about it when he just wants to find work and get paid. He could reasonably try to turn Shay over to the guard, but most of the people who live in the district like him, so Avi thinks there must be some good him. And Shay’s assessment is not entirely wrong. Avi’s life in the temple was comfortable. He had one good friend: Aubrey, a Halfling now training as a healer in the temple. She was, in truth, more like an older sister or cousin, a bit overbearing and practical wherever Avi is idealistic, but fiercely loyal and protective. Elana Skylark, the head of the temple Avi lives at, was even mildly fond of Avi, and if Avi wasn’t so nervous he couldn’t have a proper conversation with her she would help him find a place in the city using her connections beyond the temple. Of course, not all of it was good, either; most of the acolytes disliked him, and some outright bullied him. Booker Redhat, one of the temple scholars, a Gnome and the cook, disliked Avi as a rule of thumb, since when he was being taught as young child he would always ask questions rather than just accept what Booker said as fact. On the whole, he lived where he never wanted for anything; he had food, a place to sleep, and plenty of books. Now, he is trying to figure out how to make this mercenary thing works—which is why he takes the first job. "}]}

Likely due to their gender, compounded by the large curling horns that marked them as devilborn.  Found by a street gang, Ori was reared by a harsh taskmaster and leader of said gang, Alcoss, who demanded loyalty and used Ori's and Anu's size and natural dexterity to the advantage of his theives' gang. For any involved with his organization, disobedience was met with Swift and deliberate punishment, and for many, the only way out was death.  For Ori and his brother, respite came in their companionship and a pet mouse rescued from strays, named Nix. Along with forays into the city Library, and long talks with a sympathetic librarian, Molly. Unfortunately,, if discovered, both boys faced whippings.  Ori, however, had the added complications of whispered voices only half heard, shadowy figures at the edge of vision, and flares of power that he didn't understand. Although his brother tried to help and comfort Ori, the problem only grew worse the longer they tried to hide it.  The tipping point came on the day of the brothers' 16th birthday, when Anu made an attempt to steal a few sweetcakes for celebration, but instead was discovered and tossed into prison. Refused rescue by their gang leader, Ori freed his brother himself, and returned to the hideout to lay low.  Furious by their disobedience, and terrified to be discovered by law enforcement, Alcoss proceeded to chain both up, and beat then half to death.  In a last desperate move, Ori began speaking to those whispery voices, offering a deal - save him and his brother, and he would do their bidding.  As soon as the deal was struck, dark, shadowy tentacles erupted from Ori's body, breaking the shackles, and destroying walls. Fleeing the collapsing building, Ori and Anu ran back into Alcoss. In the ensuing battle, Ori lost control and smashed his brother into the side of a nearby building, bringing it down on top of both Anu and Alcoss.  Distraught by the belief that he had killed his brother, Anu fled the destruction as first responders arrived.  Pledging to save people in memory of his brother, and doing his best to refuse the maddening influence of his otherworldly benefactors."}]}

I was Shiri to my mother, but Rush was the name I’d hear as I made my way quickly through the city on errands for the shop. I learned to avoid the local children when I was young, their stares and whispers following me as I passed. On bad days, with bad people, they’d be accompanied by threats and taunts about my heritage - an incentive to find the quieter routes through the city, the less-frequented back alleys and little-known shortcuts. I knew nothing of my father other than that he must have been a tiefling – I certainly didn’t inherit my horns or tail from my human mother. Whenever I asked about him, my mother put me off with an “I’ll tell you when you’re older”, and changed the subject or sent me out on a delivery. I have always been able to do small magical tricks – nothing fancy, slamming doors shut, or causing flames to flicker, another inheritance from my father, I’m guessing – but adolescence brought with it more powerful magic, a wild magic that I struggled to control. Over time I learned to focus this magic, finding practical applications around the house, hiding my distinctive looks for a short while, and placating or defending myself from the bullies when needed. With the help of my mother’s herbal knowledge, we created concoctions that lessened the unpredictable surges of wild magic that were often a side effect of my new powers. Learning the uses of the herbs and spices we sold was a pleasant pastime we shared I was 17 when everything changed. Walking one of my usual back routes through the city, I spotted light reflecting off a small object, half-hidden under the rubbish in the alley. It was a small egg-shaped stone, pale green and mottled, slightly warm to the touch, and sent a tingling sensation up my arm when I touched it, which was somehow oddly comforting. I put it in my pocket to look at when I got home and continued with my deliveries. As chance had it, I took the same route back home, but when I turned the corner to the alley, I immediately drew back: two rough looking individuals were clearly searching for something. I heard them muttering angrily at each other, each blaming the other. “We can’t go back without it. Erakos will have our hide.” Then one of them looked up and caught me watching. I didn’t wait to find out what would happen, but turned and ran. I knew other routes home, well enough to make sure I wasn’t followed. Or at least, that’s what I thought.  Returning from my errands the next day, I found the shop in disarray, clear signs of a struggle and my mother nowhere to be found; the pendant she always wore lying in a pile of broken spice pots. In the midst of my panic my fingers found the egg, still in my pocket, and a surge of wild magic more powerful than any I’d felt before swept through me in a whirlwind. When I found my feet again I was on a mountainside, far away from any civilisation. It took me months to make my way back to the city. I survived on what I could forage, grateful of my mother’s teachings about herbs and which plants were edible or poisonous. During this time I learned that the orb focuses and strengthens my spells, but I will never entirely trust it.  When I did finally make it back to the shop, it was boarded up and any hope of a trail to lead me to my mother had long disappeared.  Since then I’ve made my own way through the world, scraping a living where I could with my knowledge of herbs and poisons, and with my magical abilities. I am always on the lookout for clues that could lead me to my mother. I am always looking over my shoulder for those that took her."}]}

While this might have meant he may have risen to a position of power in the tribe, the tribe was wiped out before that managed to happen. Roog survived only by miraculous happenstance, and the goblin child wandered about in search of a means of survival. Eventually he strayed near a human settlement, where he made a pitiable impression on a local villager, and she gave him enough food for him to survive. Roog understood he would never be accepted by the village, but he remained in its vicinity. A handful of individuals were privy to the secret of his existence, and in return for their kindness Roog did what he could to help the village: foraging the land, locating missing items, driving off small predators and warning about larger ones. The village was located near a major highway and travelers often passed through. Roog inadvertently made friends with a traveling merchant, who would see Roog whenever he was in the area. He regaled the goblin with tales of the world, and had a small treat for him to eat while he listened. One day, a particularly large goblin horde struck the town unbeknownst to Roog. He returned only once the attack was underway, and the village aflame. Terrified, he wandered through the chaos, and sought refuge in the small temple to Desna in the village. Hiding, quaking in fear, the goblin waited for the violence to pass, until some of the attacking goblins found their way into the temple. Roog couldn’t stand the idea of them despoiling it, and as he  looked up to Desna’s shrine he felt a new courage in his heart. Picking up a fallen weapon, he charged at his kinsmen and slew them. He suffered injuries of his own in the process, but that was when he felt a power inside him that allowed him to recover.  Energized, Roog charged outside but the attack was over, the goblins gone and the village destroyed. And by a cruel twist of fate, even the traveling merchant had been caught and killed. At first, Roog mourned, but in time he realized that it was never too late to use his newfound powers to help others. He swore his loyalty to Desna, vowing to protect the helpless and fight the wicked, goblins in particular. Before departing, he took a symbol of Desna from the temple to remember the village by. Roog is extremely dedicated to his cause and is quite humorless about it. He is stern, stalwart, and strong. He is absolutely an inspiring figure, although that is easily ignored because of his goblinoid nature. He is given to disguising his features with hood or helmet and passing as a halfling. "}]}

Following the Vanishing 11 years ago, there was a power struggle that was as brief as it was contentious. And when Noleski Surtova asserted his claim to the throne as the blood-descendant of Chorral the Conqueror, Natanian’s mother Inris Surtova was one of those who lost out. Inris had already grown up in the shadow of more influential siblings, and seeing this chance slip through her fingers broke her a little. Adding insult to injury, Inris’ cousin Natala, the true power behind her brother Noleski, assigned to care for a particularly distant and unimportant part of the Surtovas’ lands. Unfortunately it was the widower Inris’ sole child, Natanian, who would suffer for all that. At nine years old, most who knew him regarded Natanian as a sweet if somewhat entitled child, having been rather thoroughly spoiled by his mother ever since his father passed away several years earlier. Now, however, her treatment of him changed. Exiled and spurned, Inris cut off ties to the rest of the family and began to plot her revenge, of which her son would be the instrument. Inris became obsessed with putting her son and her branch of the family back on the throne, somehow, and this obsession came to rule young Natanian’s life from then on out. Inris saddled him with a contingent of demanding teachers and instructions, intent on preparing him body and mind to be the next ruler. Her own treatment of his became bipolar in nature: at once always dissatisfied with his progress, but also always insisting on his importance. The upshot of all this was that Natanian was saddled at once with a highly trumped-up sense of his own importance, but also a crushingly poor self-image. As he entered adulthood Natanian was forced to re-enter the world of nobility as part of Inris’ bid to put him on the throne. However, his insular and uneven upbringing had left him woefully unprepared for these complex social interactions. Thanks to both his association with his mother and his own clumsy behavior, he came to be seen as a bit of a laughingstock, and he was always painfully aware that he was being laughed at, and even more aware that he rarely got the joke. The one part of the life of nobility that Natanian found he took more naturally to was tournaments. During his tutelage, though he was by no means unintelligent, he excelled most in the physical arts, and had grown into a fit young man and a skilled warrior. With his horse Chorral, a distinctive strawberry roan, he proved quite successful, but it only did so much to help him become accepted in this world. It was at one such tourney that things went rather awry for young Natanian. It was the night before the grand melee, and he was out making a poor attempt of mingling with the other entrants. It was there that a young Lebeda noble made Natanian the target of japery, badly embarrassing him. Natanian stormed out with laughter ringing in his wake. The next day at the melee, it came to pass that Natanian and the Lebeda were the last two survivors, and they went head to head. Natanian clearly had the upper hand and was about to bring the fight to an end, but when he recognized his opponent, he instead took the opportunity to exact some revenge. He proceeded to thoroughly humiliate his foe, going far, far past the point of propriety, reducing the boy to a blubbering mess. The crowd was aghast, but Natanian was oblivious to it, feeling for the first time in his life like a true winner. Natanian had crossed a line, and there would be consequences. However, his own status as a nobility and the reputation of the Lebeda boy as a bit of an ass meant that he would have to be dealt with subtly. That opportunity arises in the plan to reclaim the Stolen Lands, and Natanian is assigned to the group heading into the Greenbelt.  Since Natanian is seen above all else as a fool, he is expected to either die in the Greenbelt or come sobbing back, humiliated enough to spend the rest of his life quietly. Inris is perfectly aware of what the assignment means, and she has already written Natanian off as a failure. In fact, the only individual seemingly unaware of the ramifications of this is Natanian himself, who looks as the assignment as an opportunity to prove himself. And it may prove to be a more of a test of character than anyone suspects – for all his faults, Natanian is a young man brimming with potential, and this represents his first chance to truly be his own man… "}]}

After his parents died he was left a sizable inheritance and he had no one other than his childhood friend, Randal Buckman. Randal nicknamed him ‘Andor’ because Stedd couldn’t pronounce his middle name until later in life. When they became adults, Randal joined the military and Stedd wanted to follow in his footsteps to do his part to protect the innocent. Due to his poor health he was denied entry until a commander named Zasheir Rein decided to use Stedd to create the ultimate soldier. Through arcane magic and intense training, Stedd grew stronger and became known as the ‘Stormwind’ due to his battle prowess as the legion’s finest fighter. During a secret mission, Randal went missing and was presumed dead. Stedd defied orders and broke rank to avenge him by pursuing the man responsible, Grigor Dotsk. Grigor was the leader of a group known as the ‘Seven Headed Serpent’ who worshipped an ancient beast as a god. The beast was known as ‘Cull’ and would absorb people into a ‘Hive mind’ in order to use them as slaves to the Demon’s will. After a harrowing campaign, Stedd put a stop to Grigor's plans and the cult. He chose to take Grigor prisoner instead of taking his life because he knew it would never bring back his friend. Stedd was rewarded for his victory and made a Captain with a unit under his command. Captain Stedd’s crew was known as the Grand Rangers. It's brand was an image of a howling wolf and his trusted lieutenants were Dorn Dundragon, Kerri Chernin, and Morn Falone, He led his unit to many other later victories and for many years but each felt more hollow. Eventually, he left the service and his friends to explore the world and find his new path. He still wears the badge of his rank, a silver shield over his heart emblazoned with a howling wolf and a golden star with a gold chevron at the top. Buckman is still presumed dead. Stedd was Rein’s only success but many others now want to replicate his work. The Grand Rangers were disbanded and his lieutenants moved on to command their own units. Since then, he walks the world alone carrying with him the emblem of the Seven Headed Serpent on a piece of a ripped banner to remind him of his loss and the evil he hopes to have wiped from existence.

One of his slave holders tried to take him away as he ran from the destruction the group was wielding against the slave traders.  The man with the weird skin and eyes rushed over and killed his previous owner, but not before falling backwards through a door that led elsewhere.  The young Damon would come to find out that this was the World Serpent Inn, and traveled to many lands from here, becoming an adventurer and gaining much wealth from his travels.  He ended up trading with many places, not always in items that were legal where he was trading, but that didn't bother him much.  One thing that he never stood for or allowed was trade in slaves (or murder, but he feels that they are almost one in the same), and would always do all he could to take down slave rings when he found them.  As fortunate and wealthy as he had become, one day while exploring the back hallways of the World Serpent Inn he found a door that he hadn't yet explored, and nor had anybody else at the point.  Upon going through the door he found a world like many others with people and magic but with technology unlike he had seen before. So he went back to the location where he came in, and tried to get back in order to better set up shop (as it's not a good idea to go into uncharted territory with many thousands of platinum worth of goods) and couldn't get back.  Knowing this happens on occasion, he tried many different methods of opening the door.  He waited for a full moon, and a new moon.  He tried when it was rainy and when it was dry.  He learned the astronomy of the land (some of which disturbed him, as it looked like the connections to the planes were off) and tried to find all the things that could have gotten him here, that would get him back, but thus far has found nothing.  The fact that Most people believe that planar travel is impossible does not make him hopeful that he will ever get back to his multi-planar businesses, and hopes that all of his friends across the multiverse are doing well.  While he (and his two traveling companions) waited to get home, they decided to set up shop and make a name for themselves here with the few goods they had.  He had come from nothing, so starting from almost nothing shouldn't be too hard. In a few short years he had a decent set of connections, both legitimate and black-market.  One of his more notable connections is with an individual known as Soliel Adrianne de Lapierre, Who was one of the first individuals he met this side of the Inn and helped him get his business running (though Soliel doesn't know this).

Prompt: \"Create a detailed backstory for a character named Searil Taltreader, an elf who belongs to the wizard class.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Birth and Early Life Not much is known about my early life. I might have been born in Halarahh or the North. My parents are essentially unknown to me. I have been told that my mother was a nomadic moon elf wizard that travelled to Halruaa to study her affinity for the arcane magic. She is believed dead, circumstances unknown. Nothing is known of my father.   After my parents deaths, I was raised in an orphanage in the new capital, Halarahh. To hide the fact that I was a poor orphan, the earliest spells I learned were from traveling mages that focused on performing simple magic that produced sparkling lights and pleasing sounds that were often woven into my shabby fabrics to enhance their beauty. I took great pains to show off my abilities and my pretend wealth and status.   Apprenticeship My fabric magic caught the eye of Gebel Barkal (human) one for the Council of Elders, Gebel Barkal, saw in me great potential with magic outside of my trifling fabric shows.  Gabel took me to live at the High Temple of Mystra on Mount Talath in Halruaa, which was home to one of the largest collections of magic in all Faerûn. Under Gebel’s and the council’s tutelage I learned to worship Mystra (the goddess of magic) and turn my studies to the School of Divination and arcane research and study. At the temple I learned order and discipline. I learned the laws of magic need to be upheld.   After 8 years under the guidance of Gabel, I was entrusted as a Lore Keeper by the Council of Elders. A Lore Keeper serves as a librarian and tour guide for the High Temple. I was tasked with organizing and keeping watch over Arcanabula books from wizards who adventured outside of Halruaa.  Journeyman Over time, I learned that my faith in Mystra and my faith in magic itself is strengthened and improved through conflict and adversity. I also came to believe that my purpose in life was to collect and keep watch over magical research and regulate the advancement and dissemination of magical knowledge throughout the mortal world. I’m a professed Guardian of the Weave, and my ambition is to repair holes in the fabric of magic. I aspire to meet, and seek Quests from, “The Chosen of Mystra” - especially if it involves battling elements of the Shadow Weave.   Turning Point A traveling wizard named Arhat Devekut came to study at the High Temple for one year. By day we studied the great texts together and at night he would tell incredible tales of the people and places he’d encountered (or avoided), When Arhat’s year of study was complete I decided to join him on his next adventures. I knew I needed to test and strengthen my magic, to practice my faith and, to carry out my purpose.   Adventuring The transition from academic to adventurer has been hard for me. Although I am very well-read and versed in lore, my adventuring and combat instincts are still weak and undeveloped. I’m still kind of a disaster-caster when it comes to combat.  Other Traits I am too trusting of creatures of similar faith. I can’t see why anyone would belong to any other faith other than Mystra. Those who worship Shar, goddess of shadows, and Cyric, god of lies, are my sworn enemy.  I am wide-eyed, eager and entirely too trusting, especially if I think there’s some lore, history or arcana to learn. Additionally, I’m not frightened by any non-undead creature or monster as I’m always eager to learn from and usually chat with them. All of this gets me into trouble a lot. I have a blind spot for creatures with deceptive motives and I will usually mistake a combat encounter for a social encounter. I’m still shocked to learn that something wants to harm me or others.  My own race (elf) and other races are of no interest to me. I know I don’t like Sorcerers and I’m suspicious of Warlocks no matter what race they are.   I’m always impressed by fighters and barbarians. Their reliance on strength over intelligence to deal damage never ceases to amaze me.   I really want to get into shape shifting. I have a cat named Anything. I am a horrible swimmer. I avoid the water and the cold.  Downtime In my downtime, I still make fabric and clothing with magical flair as it keeps me focused on protecting and communing with the Weave. I sometimes sell my pieces when I need gold.  Spellbook My traveling spell book looks like a normal deck of playing cards. On the front of the card is the familiar playing card value like the Jack of Hearts. On the back of the card is an intricately woven design that only I can decipher as the text of my spell. The lettering woven into the designs on the cards is written in the Sylvan language and uses the Espruar alphabet.  "}]}

As the fifth child to Valentin, and the first son, I was a welcome sight!  The fact that I was obviously different made him even more joyous.  They named me Soliel after the sun or solar, as I am radiant like the heavens.  My family is originally from Danor, but moved away centuries ago because of political infighting.  We had holdings in what is now Risur, and being rather rich and powerful we kept our titles through the change in location.  We also got an upgrade as we're not silly-looking tieflings!  My four older sisters instantly took a liking to me.  They, being between 2 & 9 years old when I was born had simply another playmate.  During playtime they would regularly dress me up in their dresses and, well if I had needed cosmetics I imagine they would have used it, but I'm just too pretty for cosmetics.  My father was against this, as he needed a Proper Male Heir to Take the Reins when he passed (he hasn't yet), but wasn't around enough to enforce his ruling when I was younger.  My mother on the other hand, encouraged my play.  I learned all the requisite things a little Lordling should learn, such as riding, swordplay, letters, maths, history and all the rest.  Along with that, while my father was away, my mother & sisters trained me in the more effeminate side of things.  Dancing, sewing, making & leading conversation whilst seeming to be led... Really, women are truly devious creatures, but you'd have to be one to truly know the depths of their deception.  During this time, I also taught myself - through trial and error mostly - how to be stealthy, pick locks, climb roofs, and generally be a nuisance.  It got me in quite a bit of trouble, which gave my mother quite a laugh and my father - when he found out about my escapades - just as angry.  On more than one occasion I traveled to gatherings in other kingdoms with my sisters disguised as one of them.  Never with my father present mind you, if he ever found out... Well, we'll get to that.  My parents had 3 more children, another girl, one last boy, and finally my most youngest & precious sister. (Yes, that's a total of 8 children, de Lapierre men are somewhat known for their virility. And by all accounts my father was completely faithful to my mother!!! I wonder how many children I have out there...)  My father is a good man and picked fine men for his daughters.  Like I said before, I was to be his heir, but because of reasons, he decided to name my younger brother Nathaniel heir...  Those reasons are plenty.  One of the first big reasons came when I was about 16.  My elder sisters went to a gathering of a few other children of Lords and Ladies, and I decided to go with them, but as another sister.  Most of those gathering did not know me personally, and those who did knew my proclivities.  This was all well and good... Until my father decided to show up, totally unannounced at his Baron's fief.  He walked into the room, the Baron by his side talking buisness or some such, and he saw me, stopped in his tracks, turned around, and walked out.  When I saw him do this, I went and told my sisters, and was on my way out when a messenger came up to me and told me that the Marquis de Lapierre has requested an audience with me alone in one of the side rooms.  I don't think I've ever seen my father as angry as I did that night.  He said many hurtful things that evening, which I will not go over, but it is then that he announced his decision to send me to *Jierre Sciens d’Arms* \"In hopes that they will instill some manliness back into you.  Which I should have taken care and done myself a long time ago Soliel.\"  The academy was fun, and boring, all at the same time.  It is there that I perfected my sneaking, learned many ways I could get information and favors from people, and wrote my much-contested graduate thesis: *The Best Weapon is the One Your Enemy Never Knows Of*.  My advisor suggested other names like *The Supreme Effectiveness of Concealed Weapons* that sound less like a romance novelette, but I think it gets the point across.  Indeed I did get my point across, as one of the deans who was part of the oversight committee thought that using hidden weaponry as a primary means of attack is for uncouth brutes who lack the skill and foresight to fight properly.  When I confronted him about this, while he was on the training grounds with a drawn sword and most of the school watching, I was able to use my \"uncouth and brutish lack of skill and foresight\" to mock slit his throat with a bit of ink on a cloth.  The raucous laughter heard that day lives in my heart forever... And that was the second major reason: for attempting to kill a professor at the college.  Le sigh.  I did end up graduating, but without the honors I (and most of my professors) thought I deserved.  The last straw came when we were visiting a Danorian Duke that my father was planning on doing some business with, and possibly marrying one of his daughters to one of his sons.  One of the first things the Duke showed us - and was very proud of - was an elaborate set of traps and other such devices designed to protect his valuables, including a faberge egg from some foreign land he once visited that was his pride & joy.  Three days later it was served to him on his breakfast platter.  When I attempted to tell the Duke all the ways his expensive traps fail, he exploded on me, kicked my father and I out, and was generally displeased.  The only way my father got back into his good graces was by declaring my brother heir and all but disowning me.  I have not heard anything from my father since.  He has not spoken to me or written me a letter, except for one recommending me to the Royal Homeland Constabulary, with whom I now work."}]}

As ghostwise halflings, they had minor interaction with the world outside of the Chondalwood, and she knew only the willow tree that marked the center of their territory and its surrounding brush and trees. When she was four, an elven friend of the tribe, Verisanna--a druid from the Circle of the Moon--offered to take her in and train her. Verisanna gave her a surname, Oldfur, and taught her the balance of the natural world. Her nomadic tribe visited the circle once a year, checking in with her and catching up on current events from the druids, who had more involvement with the greater world.  A naturally curious child, Tawni embraced her halfling heritage and druidic education but longed to know more about the rest of the world. She also yearned to know about her parents, of which neither the elders nor Verisanna ever spoke. As a young adult, she moved freely from the circle to her tribe, often time spending years with one or the other, always asking questions and hoarding information on written notes she carried with her. She wandered the wood, meeting other tribes and questioning them. Learning how their ways differed from hers and always asking probing questions about the ghostwise, hoping to find a lead to her parents.  She ventured out of the Chondalwood for the first time in her thirties, after she learned of the Vistani, a mysterious nomadic group that had once wandered the Chondalwood, according to a drunk ghostwise halfling she had encountered. Transforming into a crow, she flew into the Vilhon Wilds. Each time she ventured out, she stayed away longer. Both the circle and her tribe assumed her a recluse, a hermit. She surprised them both when she compiled all of the information she’d gathered for over 45 years and confronted them about her past.  The last pieces of information came from Procampur in a wizard’s tower. Waywocket Timbers once had an apprentice that convinced her Ravenloft held secrets she could add to her repertoire. She’d paid many scouts and mercenaries to retrieve texts on the subject, determined to find a way to the mysterious world. The minor obsession proved detrimental to her own work, and she abandoned it after she discharged the apprentice.   Tawni travelled to Turmish and stowed away on a ship. Transforming into an owl, she easily found her way into the tower every night for a week. A very studious and observant apprentice began noticing different texts moving, so he camped out one night. When Caldwell found her, he didn’t report her but, instead, interrogated her. This was the first time Tawni met someone as curious as herself--more curious, in fact. Caldwell helped her locate the information she wanted, sometimes reading and researching well after she left.  Confronted with Tawni’s research, the elders reveal the secrets they’ve kept. When the ghostwise exiled themselves to the Chondalwood, they discovered entrances to another world. Entire tribes would camp inside mist, going to sleep in the wood and waking up somewhere else. These tribes befriended the Vistani, a nomadic gypsy race that navigated the mists. Half ghostwise and half Vistani halflings stood as gatekeepers between the two worlds. 65 years ago, a Vistani visited the tribe and gave them an infant halfling girl named Tawni. The following day, all Vistani across the Chondalwood stepped into the mist and never came back. The ghostwise have no way of navigating the mists and are permanently separated from their brothers and sisters in Ravenloft.  The ghostwise connection to Ravenloft is a closely guarded secret. Only a few tribes and druid communities know it ever existed. This is why Verisanna asked to teach Tawni. With balance restored to the Chondalwood after the Vistani disappeared, she hoped to deter any future disturbance by instilling the virtues of nature into Tawni. After sharing the revelation, the elders looked to Verisanna, who stepped forward and gave Tawni a gift: an 18-inch-long, 2-inch-diameter Yew dowel sharpened at one end. The yew, Tawni knew, symbolized death and rebirth. “When the time is right, you will know its purpose,” she said.   Surprisingly, Tawni didn’t feel betrayed. She felt more love than she had since she was a child--that these people would work so hard to protect her. To keep her safe. To teach her about the natural balance of the world so she wouldn’t rush headfirst into a disastrous mission that could jeopardize her homeland. Agreeing to keep the secret, she still became determined to learn what happened to the Vistani. And she knew just the person that could help her.   Tawni returned to Procampur a year later, her cover story ready and excited to see her friend. When she arrived, she discovered that Caldwell no longer worked with the wizard but, instead, at a local temple. He and his friend Nymeria, a blue-skinned tiefling, were researching her demonic heritage. She agreed to help, hoping to locate more information about Ravenloft in her free time. But the temple proved sparse on the subject. She began probing Caldwell and Nymeria to move on from the Vast and explore the larger world, where they could find more information on both subjects.

Friedricksen, a human cleric in the world of D&D."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A human cleric of Oghma, born and raised in the city of Procampur along the southern coast of The Vast, Caldwell’s father, Wilhelm, worked as a scribe for a wizard, and his mother, Deirdre, worked in a library downtown. He learned to read earlier than any of the other children in school. For his 5th birthday he told his parents he didn’t want any toys, he wanted a book. When he opened it up he read it from cover to cover immediately.  Due to the aptitude he showed for learning, Caldwell’s parents sent him to school at the Sterling Academy in the Nobles District. Normally a boarding school for residents of the same district, there were some spots available for lower income families to send pupils there cheaper without room and board. While there, Caldwell met an older boy named Tikhomir Marsk who had a way with words, and for some reason, wanted to be pals with Caldwell. It turned out, that he was failing and in danger of being kicked out of the program. He impressed upon Caldwell the need for assistance in bringing his grades up. Caldwell offered to tutor him, but it didn’t seem to help much. Ultimately Tikhomir convinced Caldwell to cheat for him which was not something Caldwell wasn’t very proud of, but it kept his newfound friend in the school.  One night Tikhomir’s family house burnt down mysteriously and he he was presumed dead.  Later that year Caldwell’s mother Deirdre asked her son to see if he can find one of her pupils from the class she taught at the library. A young girl who was showing some aptitude, but suddenly stopped showing up. He looked for her everywhere he could think of, and finally found her back in the library. She was wearing a cloak that covered her appearance almost completely because she was frightened by what she was becoming. Nymeria Rex was a Tiefling who was just now at age 12 showing signs of her heritage. Small horns were sprouting from her skull and her skin was growing patches of blue scaly skin. She was scared of what people would think of her, but Caldwell was just fascinated. He comforted her and brought her to his home where she stayed for several weeks. Caldwell’s father Wilhelm offhandedly mentioned to his employer, a wizard named Ms. Waywocket “Oneshoe” Timbers, that he was boarding a young Tiefling with blue scaly skin and she jumped on the chance to adopt the young orphan.  Caldwell and  Nymeria became close friends. They mostly stayed up nights talking. Caldwell found some books about Tieflings and they read them together. After school they would play in the courtyard of Ms. Timbers’ estate, as Nymeria was still quite shy of going out in public. She did enjoy showing off her new magical abilities though, and practiced them for Caldwell in the labs of her new home. After he finished school, wanting to stay close to Nymeria, Caldwell got an apprenticeship with his father’s employer. He studied hard to become a wizard, and impressed his mentor, but his heart wasn’t really in it. Also it seemed that the better he did, the worse Nymeria was treated. The wizard wasn’t outright cruel to his friend, but she was ignored or forgotten about more than was usual. Caldwell didn’t like what his achievements were doing, so after learning a few cantrips and how to summon a familiar, he decided to leave wizard training.   One night, shortly after making this decision but before executing it, Caldwell heard a scraping on the windows of one of the upstairs rooms next to where he was studying. He went over to investigate and found an owl trying to open an unlatched window. As he watched from the shadows, the owl got through the window, transformed into a halfling woman and began going through some books. Caldwell let out a small gasp as he did not expect to see the owl change forms. This startled the woman who did not expect someone to be in this room. Rather than inform his mentor about the intruder, Caldwell questioned her himself. It turns out Tawni Oldfur had heard about the wealth of information this wizard possessed and was coming in every so often to read up on some very specific subjects that interested her. Caldwell understood that motivation at it’s base level so he endeavored to assist her. She was reading about Ravenloft and the Vistani, the latter being a people who travel the planes playing music, dancing, telling fortunes and some might say meddling in the affairs of all they meet. Caldwell and Tawni read together for a few nights and then she took off. She left him with the idea that, while books are a valuable resource for information and enrichment, there is more to discover out in the real world than can be written about.  He looked for other arcane places of study, but really found a place in the Temple of Oghma: The Domes of Reason. The temple’s existence was always known to Caldwell, as many of the books he grew up reading were donated to the library by the very same temple. As a cleric initiate of the church of the head of the Gods of Knowledge, Caldwell was as happy as a clam. He learned the inquisitive practice of unlocking the secrets of magic items or the effects of spells cast on a person or thing. He also learned how the correct intonation, posture and a bit of divine assistance can give power to words beyond what he thought possible. For the next few years, Caldwell was happy spending hours getting lost in the stacks below the temple or learning from the elder priests who regarded him as somewhat of a nuisance.  The more he learned, the more he longed for the knowledge of people and places that had been lost to civilized people. He longed to travel to Raven’s Bluff and delve below ground for scraps of ancient Dwarven lore. He wanted to help Nymeria find her parents, wherever they may be. He needed to get out and see what more could be learned in “the real world”, and what could be imparted to others who might find it interesting or even useful.  His dream is to one day be a great protector of one of the finest libraries in Faerun. He longs to collect the histories thought lost to the world and restore them so they can be used to teach people where they came from. During his training Diesa Torunn, a paladin of Dugmaren Brightmantle arrived on a personal crusade against those who ransacked her temple. She had been on the hunt for those responsible ever since, trying to retrace their steps using clues left by the perpetrators. She has come to Procampur as one stop along her quest of vengeance to seek information and chase down leads. Caldwell knew this was his chance to get out and see the world on an important mission opposing those who would dare ransack a holy site of a god of Scholarship.  "}]}

My mother died shortly after my youngest brother was born and I shared the responsibility for raising my siblings. My father was kind, but strict by necessity and taught us good manners and to respect authority. I was always the strongest of my brothers and they looked up to me. I in turn cared for them deeply.  When I was old enough, my father encouraged my to join the city militia and I began earning a small wage to send home. We handled a few skirmishes with encroaching wildlife and marauding bands of kobolds. Eventually a noble came through town recruiting men to fight in a war he was waging in a neighboring territory. The pay was 5 times what I was making in the militia, so I packed up what little I had and set out to earn my keep.  I fought in the infantry of what I now understand to be a tyrant's army. The training was excellent and the experience taught me a great deal about who I was and of what I was capable. My brother (the middle child) soon joined us and fought alongside me. We conquered many smaller civilized territories, and soon we inherited their problems. One such problem was an Ogre War-chief who decided a newly controlled town was ripe for the picking. His horde raised half of the buildings to the ground before running back into the mountains. Our band rallied and went hunting the Ogres.  The battle was met in the mouth of a large cave. After a long and bitter fight it was clear we were not going to break through the Ogres defenses. The Captain wanted to turn back, but our Commander insisted we push on. He bellowed words of courage and glory and inspired us on to achieve feats we had only dreamed of. Ultimately we were victorious and the War-chief was routed, but at great cost. After the battle I surveyed the carnage and found my Brother had been trampled in the melee. I grieved heavily, turning inward for the remainder of my deployment. I wrote my Father and remaining Brother (the youngest) explaining what had happened. I got a letter back explaining that my Father had contracted a rather serious illness and my younger brother was training to become a Cleric in the local temple of Torm. Upon receiving this news I pleaded with my superiors to let me go be with them, but was denied.  The end of my conscripted time was a bitter six months in which my training was my only solace. I threw my frustrations into my work and found a strange sense of peace in the violence. One of the officers from the elite branch of the company took notice of my increasing focus under stress. His division was less about brute force and more precision strikes, using knowledge of the anatomy of our opponents to make our attacks more effective. He saw value in me and had me moved under his command.  As far as I knew my new team was involved in more scouting and surveillance missions than straight up combat. I figured I would see how it went especially since I only had two months left on my service.  I received several more letters from my Brother about our Father who's condition was worsening. My time with the company was ended and I rushed home on the first ship I could afford. It was boarded by pirates who aimed to take the passengers and crew prisoner, possibly even sell us into slavery. I couldn't tell since they were speaking another language. Sitting bound in the hull of a ship which was my only chance to get home I remembered the words of my former commander. I tested the waters with a few words of dissent and the pirates guarding us didn't seem to understand me, so I continued on calling the crew to break free and take up arms against their oppressors. Language barrier be damned, the pirates soon discovered what I was trying to do, and came over to me to shut me up. Luckily one of my fellow passengers had escaped his bonds and overpowered one of the pirates. One of the crew helped free me and we soon had control of the ship again.  The pirates had altered our course enough that we added nearly a week to our journey. I arrived home hungry, tired, malnourished and too late to see my Father again. I met up with my Brother in the Temple of Torm and paid my respects. When I had regained my strength I helped my brother sell our family home. He had a place in the Temple and I didn't feel comfortable there anymore. So I set out on my own again. Determined to put my skills to good use opposing Tyranny in whatever form I found it. I felt a burning desire to make a name for myself because, life is short."}]}

Why am I here? How the hell did that happen? Does this smell like chloroform to you?  Unfortunately for Duane, the GM who will be running Lola and her erstwhile compatriots through the Curse of the Crimson Throne, the fine line that divides truth and fiction gets a bit hazy in Korvosa.  How Lola was initially sold into slavery appears to be a matter of some debate.  Respectable sources have provided several equally plausible explanations, the validity of which have been debated with academic vigor.  There is credible truth to the rumor that Lola talked her own parents into selling her for the sum of 18 coppers and a bag of tricks. It was a pretty good deal by halfling standards.  However, equally plausible is the explanation that a Chelaxian beekeeper found her stuffed in an apiary at the age of 12.  Lola may also have been part of an experimental halfling breeding program to reduce the cost of slaving expeditions. Unfortunately, the program was scrapped when it was discovered that the halfling work ethic gene was inextricably connected to an increased dependency on sardines, which anyone with half a brain knows are prohibitively expensive in Cheliax.  The breeding program was deemed financially unsustainable, and the Chelaxian state returned to the economically sound practice of kidnapping.  It is likely that Lola escaped from the dreaded Chelaxian Turnip Pits through circumstances both mysterious and brilliant.  There may have been a situation involving a particularly lucky set of dice, a tribe of Mwangi cannibals, and a feat of diplomacy that ended with the slavers in a very bad position.  Unless you were a Mwangi cannibal.  In a comparatively likely account, a forged application, a misplaced mailbag and a judicious dose of whiskey produced a foreign exchange program that resulted in a Chelaxian halfling named Nigella landing in Varisia, and a somewhat disappointed Shoanti exchange student named Mofongo who later wrote a strongly worded letter about the quality of dormitories at the Chelaxian Turnip Pits.  It is also entirely possible that Lola smuggled herself out of the Turnip Pits disguised as a pack of wild dogs.    Reliable sources stipulate that three halflings dressed as a Calistrian concubine supposedly arrived in Korvosa aboard the Dread A’tuin.  Lola had the misfortune of playing the left leg.  If you were not already aware, it is extremely difficult to ride sidesaddle as three halflings wearing one yellow toga.  The logistics can be somewhat distressing. The standard explanation includes an exuberant sea captain known as Roberts.  If the stories are to be believed, Lola was swallowed whole by a whale halfway across the Arcadian Ocean.  She purportedly survived off of hard tack and the barnacles growing along the creature’s esophagus.  Only her mastery of the fabled Brown Note saved Lola from certain digestion, and placed her, somewhat odoriferously, in the Korvosan harbor. Credible accounts have also indicated that Desna herself brought Lola to Korvosa on a chariot, dropping the halfling off with three gold, 50 silver and a mandate to do something anywhere but Taldor.  Incidentally, you never want to be Nigella in Taldor.  There is undeniable proof that Lola was chased by anywhere between 15 and 74 men in bath towels down Dyer’s Row.  Eyewitness accounts of the incident vary.  Apparently, this may have been due to Lola’s theft of a debutante’s virginity through unintentionally unique methods.  In fact, the young lady’s misfortune at Lola’s hands - or feet, if the rumors are correct - was due to a well-placed kick so impressively forceful that the Korvosan heiress in question suffered irreparable damage to her reputation. That is, at least, if we are to take the word of El Pompador Churrasco, philanderer extraordinaire.  Other viable explanations have implied a connection to the Laundress, a serial vandal who struck communal baths in Korvosa over a period of two and a half years.  Conservative political scholars have suggested that the Laundress may actually have been a radical member of the Elven People’s Front.  Debates are ongoing.  A third hypothesis suggests a case of unfortunate timing.  On the day in question, no less than twenty-six complaints were filed with the Brothel Owners’ Oversight Bureau citing misrepresentation of Calistrian concubines who turned out to be three male dwarves in a trenchcoat.  The bureau’s monthly meeting dissolved into riots when the coat check caught fire.  “And that’s how I ended up getting chased by the guys in bath towels down Dyer’s Row.  Then I ran into you, and we ended up here.” said Lola, polishing off Diego’s third beer.  He hadn’t actually drunk any of this one.  Or the previous two.    Diego paused to wipe down the mug with a murky dishrag before asking “But who is Duane?” "}]}

He was raised in The Hannigan Home for No-Good Children. Though fed and protected for, Lady Hannigan had no time for nonsense in the orphanage, with 12 hours a day of cleaning and crafting and an early bedtime. However, these long days and strict curfews did little to dissuade young Avidaniel from sneaking out. Every night, he would head to the Citizen’s Theater to listen to the tales from local storyteller, Margot Leitman.  It was here that Avidaniel originally got the notion that he was a demi-god. The Maiden certainly sounded like she could be his mother. They share similar values and characteristics and it could explain his mysterious origins. Drawn to these stories, Avidaniel began to train under Margot every opportunity he got, learning not only how to tell a story and play a lute, but also about to get people to trust in you and believe in your story. Before Avidan reached adulthood, Margot died of old age. Margot bequeathed Avidan a map and a note, explaining that while she didn’t believe he was a demi-god, she would not deny him an opportunity to find out who he was. The map supposedly led to the Tapestry, magical fabric that told every tale of every god. If there was to be of any evidence that he was the forgotten-son of the Maiden, it would be there. Avidan snuck out of the orphanage and left the city on a caravan.  He quickly found out he was not suited for combat, or any real physical activity. Though tall, he was lanky and somewhat feeble. Clearly, he would need someone to adventure with him, but who would adventure with a lowly, orphaned lute-player? Thus, Avidaniel took the last name Sexbang, and embraced his forged identity as self-proclaimed Demi-God of Music and Love. Avidaniel Sexbang began to weave stories of his false accomplishments and bravery, until his name became well known.

Although not as beautiful as her mother, Shakira is not unattractive. However, she has patches of scales over her body as signs of her Draconian heritage. Because of this she grew up often shunned by other children who made fun of her because of her skin. Not all the carny folk shunned her though. There was a monk within the carnival that taught her how to handle a staff, a clown who taught her all the tricks one can do with makeup, and a marksman who taught her how to use a crossbow. Her mother also taught her how to dance, sing, and play several musical instruments. Shakira the 3rd found she enjoyed playing her dad's dulcimer the most. It just felt right in her hands and left her mouth free to sing. Whenever she asked her mom about her father she would just say that \"he had the most piercing green eyes, and he was very well...built\". Then her mom would smile and gaze off into the distance.      One day her mother was ill and couldn't perform. Shakira, fearing they'd be kicked out of the carnival if they couldn't add to the show decided to go onstage herself. She went onstage with her dulcimer and sang the first thing that came to her mind, \"101 Ways to Undress a Maiden\" one of her favorite bawdy songs. As she played the audience was captivated. She loved the rush of being onstage and having people laugh with her instead of at her. When she was finished she knew she had found her true calling. Once she felt better her mom let Shakira continue to perform onstage but made her sing \"proper\" songs instead of the more racy ones that Shakira preferred. She honored her mothers request because she relished any chance to be on a stage.       As she grew older her draconian ancestry emerged even more through her innate magical ability. The dancing lights spell was the first spell she learned and used it to enhance her performances. However, one day after a particularly mean joke from a goblin heckler her emotions got the better of her and she began hurling insult after insult at the man. This was a skill she was good at since she had been made fun of her entire life, even with scales she had developed a thick skin. Her words hurt his feelings and he began to cry a little bit. However, she was on a role and while insulting the man she accidentally summoned her first fire bolt. There were some minor injuries and burns but nobody was killed, however, the troupe lost a tent to the flames. Fearing her magical ability she was banished from the carnival by the end of the week.        A tearful goodbye with her mother saw Shakira leave the carnival on her own. Her mother let her keep the dulcimer left by her father and wished her well. Shakira begged her mom to come with her but she said this was the only life she has known. She had taught Shakira all she knew about entertaining and it was up to her to learn more about her magical abilities and her heritage. so she left and roamed the countryside by herself seeking small towns and taverns where she could perform in taverns and make some gold. Without her mom to stop her she became known as Naughty Shakira for her lyrics and songs were said to make even the hardest of men blush. She's been on the road for a few years seeking fortune, fame, and clues about her father. Although she has gone on a few small adventures she is known more for her skill as an entertainer than as a warrior, though perhaps that's about to change..."}]}

Both my parents –my father a Human, the son of a wealthy Breland merchant and head of a guild, and my mother an Elf, the daughter of a powerful and old Elven family – were betrothed to marry others long before they were born. One to seal a lucrative business deal, the other to keep peace between two houses, but this was not to be. From first sight Urilee and Albrecht fell in love. They kept their relationship secret until I was born, during the end of the Last War. I was given the Elven name Aravae, which means great joy and happiness. When the secret was discovered, both families blamed the other for the deception, and a plan was made to kill me – the bastard child – and punish my parents for shaming them. Albrecht was slain at the hands of his own father Radbrecht, and my mother Urilee fled with me from Valenar to the forests of the northern Breland mountains, where we took refuge with a band of roving Ronin like Rangers – trackers, hunters and assassins for hire. This is where I learnt my skills, protecting the forest, moving as silent as a shadow, and killing faster and quieter than Nerull himself. I was given the name Trivium by my Ranger master, which roughly translates as the Outcast Son.  My mother died of a broken heart when I was no more than 10, she never took another lover, nor looked at another man – no one could hold a candle to her long lost Albrecht. On my mother’s death bed she made me promise not to seek revenge for the ills done to our small family, as it seemed we were forgotten and had lived in apparent peace amongst the Rangers of the woods.  Yet, as all sons are meant to break their mother’s hearts, I’ve journeyed as a protector with a troupe of Bards to the sea port in (Sharn) in an attempt to learn more of my hated grandfather’s guild house and Elven family, and eventually exact my revenge.   I’m 25, medium height, solid but wiry frame. Green piercing eyes and a tangle of black hair is tied loosely at the nape of my neck letting my slightly embarrassingly large Elven ears poke through. I’m reserved and quiet at best, with a dark sense of humour and a love of strong ale. My temper when provoked is frightening and bestial, with the silent brute of the forest is a better descriptor for me.    When Trivium was merely 16 and still an apprentice to the Ronin Rangers we embarked on a mercenary mission to save a stupid young son of a Breland official amongst the Greywall Mountains. My brothers of the Ronin Rangers and I ventured too far over the border into Droaam and stumbled into an Ogre tribal group, which didn’t go well for our unaware band.  We suffered many casualties, the Ogres ripping the slower members limb from limb, it was a blood bath. My Ranger master screamed at me to stay back and managed to slay a number of the hairy stinking hulks before being wounded himself, his sword arm smashed to splinters by an Ogre club. Seeing my master bewildered and bloody at the foot of an Ogre barbarian I leapt upon it’s back taking its head off in one slash of my kukri before he could land a death blow. As terrified as I was of the Ogres, I dragged my heavily injured master from the fray with our remaining comrades and fled to the cover of the higher mountains.  It wasn’t until the adrenaline wore off that I noted I was missing 2 fingers from my left hand – the pinky and ring fingers – possibly bitten off by the Ogre I killed. The Breland official’s son was later found eviscerated and nailed to a tree on the western border of Breland and Droaam, we were obviously too late in finding him. "}]}

One dark winter 97 years ago, his gnomish village was under attack from a clan of Drow seeking slaves. Ku's grandfather, Mather, snuck behind enemy lines to assassinate the powerful warlock orchestrating the drow army's tactics. When he entered the warlock's tent, he found a crystal globe with swirling darkness within on the table. Its whispers almost entranced him, but he resisted, picked up the globe, and smashed it down on the drow warlock's skull. The globe shattered, releasing the shadows within, which swirled around him and sank into his skin, turning it an ashen gray. He also gained supergnomish strength, which enabled him to fight his way out of the drowish camp. Mather made it back to his village and the gnomes defeated their enemies, but Mather was never the same. Many years later, after he and his ladyfrien had Ellyjobell's mother, Mather rose sleepwalking one night and disappeared into the woods. When his gnomish friends searched for him, they found no sign of Mather, but discovered that a once unremarkable clearing had been enshrouded in a mysterious darkness. That darkness never lifted from that day to this, and for decades the gnomes of the village avoided it.  Ellyjobell's mother, Fuder, was eyed warily by the other villagers throughout her childhood. She inherited her father's ashen skin, uncanny strength, and penchant for staring, not blinking for days at a time. By the time she was a teenager, a bony hound followed her throughout the village. She made the other children nervous, and she took to playing in the woods, often romping through the shady clearing where her father had vanished, and avoiding other gnomes. Much to the other villagers' surprise, when she was 17, she became pregnant. She never revealed who (or what) the father was, and before she gave birth, she decamped from the village to a lean-to she had constructed on the edge of the shady clearing. Ellyjobell grew up accustomed to the soothing whispers that emanated from the shadows. Whenever she played there with the spectral dogs who befriended her, she felt as though she were being watched by generations of family.  But tragedy once again struck Ellyjobell's small family when she was 17. A human king sent his army to wipe out the gnomish village in an effort to cleanse all non-humans from his lands. Far outnumbered, the gnomes sought out Fuder and begged her to use her dark powers to save them. Fuder demurred, confessing she didn't know anything about dark powers, and while strange things sometimes happened to her, she didn't know how to control them, but after hours of cajoling, she surrendered to the gnomes and agreed to join the battle against the humans. At first Fuder was lost in the fray, terrified of the flying slings and javelins, trying just to stay alive. But as she saw her fellow gnomes being senselessly slaughtered around her, her fear turned to rage, and a great shadow swept over the humans on the battlefield. When the darkness lifted, the human army had vanished. So had Fuder.  With nothing left to keep her near the land of her birth, Ellyjobell took her favorite dog -- a black mastiff she had found among a litter abandoned in the woods and bottle-raised -- and struck out into the wider world. What powers does she have, and to what ends will she use them? Only time will tell."}]}

For the next few years, Duffle learned the shanties of the sea and fell in love with the music. As the charming and musically gifted Duffle traveled with the group, she became their reliable distractor. Prying attention away from her crew mates as they played on with their deeds, comprised of unhinging corrupted leaders, saving damsels and uncovering drug deals. They were, of course, mostly in it for the money, but Duffle was not about to argue with that. One day, the group discovered rumors of a drug deal in a sea port they were currently in. The gnome and the Courting Sails snuck around in the cover of night to find a drop off in an abandoned part of the port, covered in broken beams and decaying wood. The dropee no where in sight. In the bag was indeed filled with drugs. Duffle proposed switching the drugs with herself. This way, the group can get the drop on the person. The group all agreed and the drugs were removed and Duffle was placed in the bag. The plan went with more or less without a hitch. The group collected their reward and Duffle was rewarded her name. A name to forget all other names. She was no longer the gnome she used to be. Only Duffle.  After several more years, the group became smaller and smaller and soon there were no more Courting Sails. Duffle started singing in taverns for money. She sang her old shanties with pride. One day, she meet a Teifling bard named Meelech in a tavern called GoodBarrel.

As he grew older however, the Blackcreek family learned to adjust to his condition, treating him the same as his brother and sister, and doing their best to find a place for their youngest in a world that looks on him with suspicion. Through his strength, dedication, and a word of recommendation from his Uncle, Faller was thrilled to acquire a steady job with the city guard, and swore to do what he could to make his family proud and his city safer. But as the years passed, his excitement at his prospects slowly faded as it became clear that he was to be shuffled to the sidelines, mostly given drunktank and archive duty while occasionally being called in to intimidate particularly uncooperative suspects. Frustrated by the disdain of his boss, his inability to prove himself, and his nonexistant prospects to advance, Faller decided to take matters into his own hands. He began to look into old unsolved cases in his free time, and then eventually into open ones as well, throwing himself into questionable and far fetched avenues of investigation that his colleagues wouldn't consider.

Maple is a halfling ranger."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maple Prestrien Hopriver is the daughter of an unusually adventurous halfling or hobbit, Matilda Hopriver (an offshoot of the Took clan), and a strangely down-to-earth High Elf ranger named Fenran, who left with his scouting party after only a few days’ rest in the Shire. Maple was raised quietly, neither discouraged from adventure nor encouraged to try and fit in with the young halflings around her, which would be in vain - going by height alone, she could pass for a very short, rather stocky human. She has very curly, dark blonde hair and dresses mostly in brown, black and mustard yellow, carrying a short sword, and rarely much else. She began her adventuring career as True Neutral.  Maple’s companion is a large, loyal moose named Tantalus, whom she met in the forest near her home. Tantalus has no special abilities outside of a relatively high intelligence - he is able to understand various commands and communicate with Maple through subtle non-verbal actions, such as mimicking her body language as best he can. He has a very impressive rack of antlers, which tends to get tangled in dense areas of forest. He serves as a mount and pack animal to Maple, and is, naturally, capable of doing severe damage to an assailant due to his sheer size and sharpened antlers.  Despite her friendship with Tantalus and frequent forays into the nearby forests, Maple never ventured far from the Shire until the arrival of a tired party heading south on a trial mission for the White Talon Adventurers’ Guild. This party, consisting of a male human sorcerer named Hadrian, a male half-orc warrior called Zanagar, a female human bard named Desdelmone, and a young tiefling Paladin-in-training who calls herself Hero, received Maple’s hobbit hospitality with gratitude, and, spurred by her interest in the guild, invited her to accompany them on their little quest.  Maple made fast friends with Hero, who really didn’t understand the difference between good and evil but who looked up to paladins and berserkers as people of courage and conviction; but the halfling’s greatest initial interest was in Hadrian, who she was hopelessly attracted to. Having always thought of herself as more or less human - the species whose houses were the same size as hers - Maple was slow to realize that Hadrian perceived her as starkly inhuman, like Hero and Zanagar - supporting characters to the (really fairly inexperienced) Hadrian and (utterly useless) Desdelmone. However, it wasn’t until the end of their mission, which Hero somehow managed to turn into a dragon-slaying quest, that Hadrian kissed Des and Maple’s heart was broken.  Her party found her that night in a tavern, drunk for the first time in her life, and Hadrian began to realize rather dully that the non-human members of the party were nonetheless full-fledged people, as he comforted Maple - oblivious to the reason she was upset. Maple silently forgave him, but was prepared to return home for good until the party begged her to stay. She had shown rare bravery, not only in fighting the party’s final battle, but also in putting a merciful end to the suffering young beast the party had picked up in the jungle, when no one else could manage it. She resolved to befriend Zanagar, to counsel Hero, and to support Des and Hadrian, naive as they were, in their mission to become the greatest adventurers in all of history (not particularly likely, but a nice sentiment).  This expedition was the first of many. "}]}

Melissan is a tiefling of the fighter class."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Curt of speech, ruthlessly practical, and yet strangely beautiful, Melissan is a woman who has yet to fully shed the emotional armour guarding her from harm. Despite this emotional distance, Melissan can show loyalty, even nobility, to those who earn her trust. That said, in combat, nothing is ruled out. For her, a fair fight is for fools who will be crushed by the ruthless – and she has no desire to be crushed again. With her turquoise hair, amber eyes that almost glow, two small horns and a small spade-headed tail, there can be little doubt of Melissan’s heritage, for she is a tiefling.  Melissan was born in the devil-ruled nation of Cheliax on the 12th of Desnus, 4639 AR. Like most tieflings in that benighted land, Melissan was born out of wedlock: in this case, a forbidden tryst between a tiefling and Iulia Vitaron, a lesser noblewoman from Westcrown bound to House Mazinas. As befits a tiefling bastard of a noble in Cheliax, the babe was left on the doorstep of The Sanctum of Order – an orphanage run by the church of Asmodeus – with a pittance of coin to pay the priests to keep the babe. The baby, named Melissan, was raised under the strict, unfeeling tutorage of lesser clergy of the Lord of Hell, suffering bullying from both her peers, who taunted her for her otherworldly appearance, and by the priests, who would beat the children ruthlessly for any infraction, real or perceived. Nonetheless, Melissan had learned to read and write, both in her own tongue and in the tongue of hell, which she proved strangely adept at grasping. By the age of twelve Melissan, however, had fled the Sanctum rather than face another beating, and she eventually drifted into the Parego Dospera, the ruined northern section of Westcrown.  Her youth passed quickly for a tiefling, and Melissan quickly turned to theft to survive. At first, she stole only food and clothes, sleeping in ruined buildings and hiding from both the Dottari – the watch of Westcrown – and the dangerous squatters and monsters that dwelled in the ruins. Her talents brought her to the attention of the Council of Thieves, who attempted to recruit her as a “puller” for their organization, tasked with acquiring things for the council. At first, the promise of steady gold and food drew young Melissan in, and as she quickly passed the Guild’s training, she felt a certain level of acceptance, though only a lowly cutpurse. However, as the years passed and Melissan reached the age of 20, she came to realize that the Council viewed her as a mere expendable asset, even as the tasks became more and more dangerous. Eventually tasked with joining in a shakedown of a group of merchants from Druma – and their mercenaries – Melissan decided that she’d had quite enough of taking hits for the corrupt plutocrats of the council. Tipping off her targets to their impending ambush, and taking their coin, Melissan robbed a small shop for supplies, before fleeing Westcrown.  Naturally outraged, the Council sought revenge. Her crime of robbery was quickly discovered, and while the Dottari were unable to seek her beyond the walls of the city, the Hellknights of the Order of the Scourge were not. Captured in nearby East Rikkan, the Hellknights had Melissan flogged, and sold into slavery for her crime. Fortunately for her, the Hellknights were no friend to the Council in Westcrown, and she was shipped north along the Adivian River, to Egorian – the City of Thorns and capital of Cheliax.  The trip took only a week and a half, but the cramped confines of the foul-smelling slave barge and the brutality of the slavers made it seem to last for months. The slaves were not once brought above decks, and while Melissan’s ability to see in the dark helped her – especially when her captors sought a good-looking slave to have their way with, and she needed to hide – she was unprepared for the glare of the sun when the barge finally docked in Egorian. With a heavy iron collar and manacles, Melissan and the other unfortunates were led through jeering crowds to Whipcrack district, stripped naked and paraded in front of potential buyers. Whilst most slaves hung their heads in shame, using their chains and hands to hide their nethers, Melissan stood upright, staring ahead in blank defiance. Many buyers were put off by her fiendish appearance, but many more were not willing to buy an unbroken slave. As a result she was sold directly to the city, to work as little more than a tool that can talk, cleaning sewers, fixing roads, and generally doing the unpleasant tasks assigned to her.  The decades ground past painfully slowly and dully. For seven years, she worked as a city slave until she attempted to flee one too many times for her masters; from there she spent twenty-two long years being bounced from one master to another, some who used her for labour, others for magical research, and some others for their perverse pleasures, whether in the bedchamber or in a fighting pit. While some of her masters met unfortunate fates at her hands – cleverly disguised as accidents – by the time Melissan reached the age of 49, she had become a bitter, withdrawn woman, building up emotional armour around her even as her physical skin toughened under blows and beatings.  Once again, she found herself in Whipcrack on the auction block, and she once again showed her customary defiance. This time the auctioneers were not in the mood to tolerate her, and were about to beat her to a bloody pulp for her insolence. Just as the cudgel was raised, a well-dressed man with a long red robe and a neatly-trimmed beard came up with his retainers. Holding out his hand imperiously to order them to stop, he gave Melissan a look up and down, and smiled cruelly. “This one I’ll take. 50 gold.” The slaver was about to start haggling, but one icy look from the man silenced him. The gold was exchanged, and like that, Melissan was someone’s property again.  The man in question was Paracount Morvius Enteraii, a powerful Chelish noble and arcanist with ties to the Church of Asmodeus. As she was led by his burly guards out of Whipcrack, the Paracount suddenly turned to her, his face a mask of anger, and not the visage of the demure lord she had seen earlier. “Remember this, slave” he spat. “You are now mine; work well, and you shall do so in comfort, but fail me… know that my capacity for pain is limitless.” With a nod from Enteraii, the guards forced her to her knees and a red-hot brand with his personal emblem, a stylized E on the back of a stylized M, was placed on her back. Melissan screamed; though her otherworldly heritage gave her some protection against the fire, none of her other masters had ever branded her, and it was agonizing pain. With tears and sweat stinging her eyes, she was hauled up to her feet, and made to walk halfway across the city.  Morvius was amongst the crueler masters Melissan had ever worked for; beatings were common, and the chores were laborious and difficult. Melissan’s spirit wavered in the face of the terrifying Paracount, and she became more servile to keep herself safe. As the years went on, Melissan’s intelligence and sheer endurance saw her rise in the pecking order of the slaves, eventually moving her into the Paracount’s household and, after eight years of servitude, the head of Enteraii’s household slaves, making sure tasks were organized and keeping the rest of the household slaves in line.  Melissan may well have spent her life toiling under the heel of Morvius if it were not for  -where she met a young Jeffrey Ebersbach, whom she befriended. -“For years Jeffrey had, with Melissan’s help, taken every opportunity to perform little acts of sabotage around the house. Sometimes he would place pieces of art on subtly precarious angles so when his robed master walked past, the air current would knock it to the ground, destroying the object; other times he’d re-arrange things to make it difficult for the pompous Entenraii to find. Unfortunately, the Paracount was arrogant, not stupid; after destroying a priceless Osirioni vase, the furious noble used his arcane powers to set up watches around his house, and quickly caught Melissan and Jeffrey laughing about their deed. The Paracount was not amused. Screaming in rage, he had both of them beaten until their backs were raw and bloody, and threw salt on them, causing Jeffrey nearly to faint in agony.  “I warned you!” Morvius raged. “I warned you all those years ago. You could have lived in comfort, but *no*… so now you will know what true toil means!” After a few days recovering, Jeffrey and Melissan were sold, this time to the brutal northern slave pits, destined to spend the rest of their lives toiling in the dark and, should they not lose their lives to cave ins or poisonous gas, they might well be murdered in one of the bustling slave fighting pits set up by the owners. Clearly, the Paracount wanted Jeffrey and Melissan’s deaths to be drawn-out and painful.  For the next year, the two former house slaves lived lives of suffering and toil, spending their days with picks in their hands and little more than rags for their clothes. The overseers were brutal, and some of their fellow slaves not much better. While Jeffrey grew strong and channelled his hatred into a rage which could see him through, Melissan had to be cunning to avoid be raped or killed, and she was forced to kill more than a few other slaves to defend herself. Melissan’s cunning and Jeffery’s strength brought them to the attention of Hakon.  Hakon was a burly Halfling, easily Jeffrey’s match for strength, and a charismatic character as well, who had been slowly gathering a core of supporters around him. After a few tests – mainly involving acts of sabotage against minor installations and also the killing of a slave who was snitching to the guards – Hakon brought Jeffrey and Melissan into his circle. The black-bearded Halfling had been for nearly three years laying the groundwork for a massive revolt and breakout, relying on his knowledge of the mines and a stash of weapons that he had been secretly stockpiling. Jeffrey and Melissan’s talents were put to good use bringing his plan to fruition, and within a month, in the depths of the Menador winter, the slaves struck. Over thirty guards were killed and much of the infrastructure put to the torch, but the revolt was crushed when the mine Overseer unleashed a trio of ogre mercenaries into the slaves, killing Hakon and his chief bodyguard. Leaderless, the slaves panicked and attempted to flee into the hills and tunnels. The resulting massacre was frightful, but Jeffrey and Melissan managed to escape, though as they trudged through the deep snow, they got lost and separated from each other.  In order to avoid detection in Molthune, she had to go upriver, around the edge of Lastwall. She was captured by Orcish raiders; apparently her filthy appearance was enough to put them off raping her, but she was beaten and sold into slavery again, this time to an half-orc who ran a really rough bar in Uglir. After several years of working as a bar slave, a bar fight breaks out and in the confusion she manages to fight her way out. Armed with little more than a table leg and clothes, she somehow survived through Belkezan, Ustalav, and finally the River Kingdoms, where she found work in some tiny backwater called Chyrrwild, working for an adventurer who was part of the little kingdom’s government. That adventurer was Ulrik van Woodstone."}]}

That latter injury he keeps hidden under the fearsome helm he never seems to remove in public. Jeffrey’s personality is as much a mask as his helm, for beneath his seemingly laid-back attitude and gallows humour, he hides a lifetime of wounds and a desire for vengeance. The façade only slips in combat, when he gives into his anger and becomes a rampaging, bellowing incarnation of death.  Jeffrey’s memories of his home and childhood are blurry at best, but he clings to them as a drowning man would to a plank of wood. Born on the 25th of Erastus, 4688 AR, Jeffrey came into this world in a small and virtually unknown region of the Menador Mountains, the great mountain range that separates Imperial Cheliax from its northern neighbours of Nidal and Molthune. There, nestled within the rocky peaks and hills of the eastern end of the Chelish-controlled part of the range lies the Canton of Solothurn – a series of tiny hamlets united by family ties and a resistance to outside rule. Due to their remoteness, the hamlets of Stonearch, Gillian, Lorg’s Hill, and Veibourg were left largely unscathed during the years of civil war and the Thrune Ascendancy. As such, the people of Solothurn continued in their traditional worship of Erastil… and this was to prove to be their demise.  In those early years, Jeffrey was the youngest of three brothers. His older brothers, fraternal twins Bern and Uri, were three years older than Jeffrey, and like him his brothers were strong, boisterous lads. When they weren’t training with spear and club to eventually become part of the canton militia, were always getting up to all sorts of larks and good-natured pranks, and having a riotous good time sneaking mead out from the cellar. His father Andretti was the village brewer, and whilst he was burly and gruff, with a stoic exterior as tough as granite – much like most men of Solothurn – beneath beat the heart of a kindly, generous man, ready to give aid and hospitality to any who asked it. For her part, Jeffrey’s mother Juliana was a hard-working and iron-willed woman who looked after her family with as much dedication as a paladin to his cause. Being the youngest of the family, Juliana doted on young Jeffrey, joking calling him “her runt of the litter”, despite being quite tall for a boy.  This idyllic lifestyle came to a crashing and tragic end shortly after Jeffrey’s 10th birthday. No one knows how the Chelish Horse and Nidali slavers found the hidden Canton, but found it they did. Under the cover of a heavy autumn rain they came, when the men of the village were hard at work under the mountain, following veins of copper that was the lifeblood of the village. With lethal precision, the watch at the entrance fell to crossbow bolts tipped with a lethal poison, and by the time the alarm was raised, the slavers were already amongst the buildings. A panicked defence of the village was attempted, but there were far too few of the militia to stave them off, and the Chelish Horse did bloody work dispersing any attempt to rally. Meanwhile, women and children screamed and attempted to flee as their homes were put to the torch, but the black-cowled Nidali slavers knocked then down with cudgel blows.  Juliana and young Jeffrey hid in their house, barring the door in vain hope of some refuge from the pandemonium raging outside, but it was a vain hope. After a few stout hacks from an axe, the door gave way in a shower of splinters and several of the Chelish soldiers burst in. In short order, they had knocked Julianna to the ground and had taken hold of Jeffrey, but in that moment, a howl of anger erupted outside of the house. Bern and Uri had heard the attack while they were resting outside the mine, and had sped to the village’s defence, spearing one of their family’s assailants through the chest.  Moments later, as Jeffrey opened his mouth to call out to his brothers, a maille-clad fist descended into his field of view. Then, all was blackness.  When Jeffrey awoke, with a great pain in his head and face sticky with his own blood, he found himself in a crowded, dimly-lit wagon, barred with heavy wood and filled with captured men, women and children, many of whom had been knocked out like him and were just coming to. Others were sobbing, or simply staring out into the inky blackness of night. Jeffrey frantically tried to find his mother, or his brothers, but in the tightly packed confines of the cart as it rolled along the mountain path he was barely able to move, and so spent the night in the corner, waiting for the dawn.  When morning came, the wagon was brought to a halt, and the captives inside were marched outside. As Jeffrey’s eyes adjusted to the light, he could see a line of people chained together by iron collars, waiting with downcast eyes by a fork in the road. The black-robed Nidali were nowhere to be seen, but the footprints in the road and the number of empty collars in the chain left little doubt that they had taken their share and left. Jeffrey and the others in the cart were chained in and told to march. Any who couldn’t walk were whipped; any who couldn’t get up had their throats slit and left on the side of the road to rot.  After several weeks of hard marching, in which they were given precious little food – much of which was barely edible – and often had their sleep interrupted, Jeffrey and the others were herded into the great city of Egorian – the City of Thorns. Without warning, their captor’s cruelty changed from ruthless practicality to a perverse glee, as if the red-and-black stone or the cruel rooftop spikes brought out the worst of them. “Welcome to the last stop on the line, scum!” one of them shouted. “Soon you’ll be sold to your new masters, and *we’ll* make a tidy profit of you. Now MOVE IT!” Jeffrey quickly found himself being dragged with the others down the perfectly-straight main road before being shunted off to Whipcrack – the bustling heart of the slave market, a mixture of auction stands and dwellings of the rudest kind, many of them halfling height. It was like time froze as Jeffrey’s level of fear reached borderline panic. By the time he’d regained his senses, he was on an auction block being sold like a piece of beef. The poor lad was stripped to his skivvies to show the crowd of his “fine physical potential” and soon he was purchased by a particularly harsh master – Paracount Morvius Entenraii, a self-important noble and a high-ranking member of the Church of Asmodeus.  The Paracount was not a kind master. Upon purchasing Jeffrey, he had his cheek branded with his personal emblem, a stylized E on the back of a stylized M. To this day, Jeffrey has nightmares of that moment: of the pain, the smell of his flesh burning, the stinging tears rolling down his mangled cheeks before a bucket of water was thrown in face. Entenraii then took hold of the boys chin and locked him with a cruel stare. “Remember this, slave” he spat. “You are now mine; work well, and you shall do so in comfort, but fail me… know that my capacity for pain is limitless.” Without a further word, Jeffrey was clapped in manacles and hauled onto a cart by one of the Paracount’s stocky guards, and wheeled off to his estate in the district known as Hell Hound Hill. For the next six years of his life, Jeffrey was one of Entenraii’s household slaves, living a miserable existence of menial chores, meager food, and casual brutality for even the slightest mishap. Jeffrey became fairly withdrawn, his nights plagued with dreams of his family and their possible fate, but his spirit never broke to his master’s will, thanks in no small part to a tiefling slave by the name of Melissan. The head of the household slaves, Melissan was hardly the warm and fuzzy type, but her gallows humour and ready smile when the Paracount wasn’t around helped boost Jeffrey’s spirits even in his darkest moments.  Jeffrey might well still be languishing as the Paracount’s household slave if it weren’t for an incident in his sixteenth year.  For years Jeffrey had, with Melissan’s help, taken every opportunity to perform little acts of sabotage around the house. Sometimes he would place pieces of art on subtly precarious angles so when his robed master walked past, the air current would knock it to the ground, destroying the object; other times he’d re-arrange things to make it difficult for the pompous Entenraii to find. Unfortunately, the Paracount was arrogant, not stupid; after destroying a priceless Osirioni vase, the furious noble used his arcane powers to set up watches around his house, and quickly caught Melissan and Jeffrey laughing about their deed. The Paracount was not amused. Screaming in rage, he had both of them beaten until their backs were raw and bloody, and threw salt on them, causing Jeffrey nearly to faint in agony.  “I warned you!” Morvius raged. “I warned you all those years ago. You could have lived in comfort, but *no*… so now you will know what true toil means!” After a few days recovering, Jeffrey and Melissan were sold, this time to the brutal northern slave pits, destined to spend the rest of their lives toiling in the dark and, should they not lose their lives to cave ins or poisonous gas, they might well be murdered in one of the bustling slave fighting pits set up by the owners. Clearly, the Paracount wanted Jeffrey and Melissan’s deaths to be drawn-out and painful.  For the next year, the two former house slaves lived lives of suffering and toil, spending their days with picks in their hands and little more than rags for their clothes. The overseers were brutal, and some of their fellow slaves not much better. But Jeffrey was growing to manhood, and as his strength grew, so too did his anger. He held onto the faces of the loved ones he lost, and the faces of those who had oppressed him. When forced into one of the fighting pits, he channelled that hatred into a rage and beat his opponent into a ruin. It was his strength, combined with Melissan’s cunning, which brought them to the attention of Hakon. Hakon was a burly Halfling, easily Jeffrey’s match for strength, and a charismatic character as well, who had been slowly gathering a core of supporters around him. After a few tests – mainly involving acts of sabotage against minor installations and also the killing of a slave who was snitching to the guards – Hakon brought Jeffrey and Melissan into his circle. The black-bearded Halfling had been for nearly three years laying the groundwork for a massive revolt and breakout, relying on his knowledge of the mines and a secret stash of weapons that he had been secretly stockpiling. Jeffrey and Melissan’s talents were put to good use bringing his plan to fruition, and within a month, in the depths of the Menador winter, the slaves struck. Over thirty guards were killed and much of the infrastructure put to the torch, but the revolt was crushed when the mine Overseer unleashed a trio of ogre mercenaries into the slaves, killing Hakon and his chief bodyguard. Leaderless, the slaves panicked and attempted to flee into the hills and tunnels. The resulting massacre was frightful, but Jeffrey and Melissan managed to escape, though as they trudged through the deep snow, they got lost and separated from each other. Jeffrey survived by taking shelter in a small abandoned mine; there, shivering in the gloom, he came across an ancient helm that was in surprisingly good condition. More importantly, the helm – shaped like the maw of a snarling beast – hid his slave brand entirely.  During the next agonizing four weeks, Jeffrey made his way through the mountains and into neighbouring Molthune. Fortunately as one of the main fighters in the revolt, Jeffrey had gotten himself enough clothing and armour to not look like an out-of-place slave; while Molthune was not part of Cheliax, its own Imperial desires wouldn’t stop local law enforcement from simply seizing a runaway slave and putting him or her to work for their own ends. Nevertheless, Jeffrey moved as quickly and unobtrusively as possibly, stealing or fighting to survive, until he managed to stow away in a merchant vessel leaving the port of Korholm bound for Caliphas, in far-off Ustalav. From there it was easy enough to head east, into the land where no slaver could touch him: the River Kingdoms.  Even in distant Cheliax, Jeffrey had heard tales of the River Kingdom of Tymon; a nation of gladiators, where all prestige and even the rulership of the land was won or lost in the gladiatorial pits. Jeffrey felt that this was a place where he could learn to fight properly and gain the skills –and coin – to try and reassemble his shattered life. Alas, Jeffrey was penniless, with little more than an ancient helm, some rent chainmail, and a pitted shortsword to his name. He was highly unlikely to be admitted into the prestigious Valknar Gladiatorial College and without an income to improve his equipment, he’d be lucky to survive a single bout in the Arena of Aroden.  Fortunately the gods were smiling on young Jeffrey. After scrounging up enough coppers to get himself a cell in the local flophouse, he wandered the streets in the dying light of the day. As he rounded a bend, he heard angry shouting and cries of pain coming from an alley. A trio of rather rough looking characters were laying into a well-dressed bearded man of advancing years, angrily demanding where he had “put the money”. Drawing his battered sword, Jeffrey charged in, roaring in anger and letting that familiar surge of adrenaline speed him into battle. The three toughs turned to face him, but quickly fled in sheer terror; unbeknownst to Jeffrey, that ancient helm of his was actually a helm of fearsome mien, and his anger had awoken the helm’s power to intimidate and terrify. Having dealt with his attackers, Jeffrey helped the bruised man to his feet. Taking Jeffrey’s hand in his own in a vigourous handshake, the older Taldan gentleman introduced himself as Doctorè Alexandros Demos, one of the teachers at the Valknar College.  “I am in your debt, young sirrah” Alexandros beamed. “Tell me, what brings you to Tymon?”  After a long discussion over ales in the local tavern, Alexandros made Jeffrey a deal. Although he couldn’t get Jeffrey enrolled in the College – the Dean, Erevil Antelo, sneered down his nose at the underfed former slave, predicting confidently he’d not survive a week in the arena – the good Doctorè paid for Jeffrey to receive tutelage from weaponmasters and older gladiators. He learned to fight, to bear the weight of armour, and how to please the crowd. Alexandros personally taught Jeffrey the technique of the “jaguar pounce”: to seize the initiative and to inflict hideous wounds while the foe was still awe-struck. Ultimately Jeffrey’s style of combat was less about technique and more about the anger and adrenaline, leaping towards the foe and never giving them a moment to breathe or withdraw.  Jeffrey spent the next seven years of his life in Tymon. After two years of training, and several bouts in the grand arena, in which Jeffrey found himself a sort of dark-horse favourite, Erevil Antelo relented, and he was inducted into the college as a full member. Although he enjoyed a friendly rivalry with his classmates, Jeffrey still kept to himself, training with every ounce of his strength to one day rescue those dear to him. He continued to fight in the arena, earning gold and prestige – by this point, he had chosen a particularly nasty falchion as his main weapon. Alas, Jeffrey left Tymon with a bad taste in his mouth. After his patron Alexandros Demos had a particularly nasty falling out with the Dean, Antelo then proceeded to humiliate and slander Demos in the public sphere, causing him to resign from the college and leave town. Jeffrey left soon after, and for the next year he wandered the River Kingdoms, offering his skills as a mercenary, fighting for Gralton and Pitax. It was during his service to the later that Jeffrey learned that not only was Melissan alive, but she had recently made her way north, into the so-called “Stolen Lands.” Apparently some upstart adventurers had started settling the Greenbelt, and Melissan had moved there. Ending his contract as quickly as he could, Jeffrey packed up his gear and followed in pursuit…"}]}

Determined to catch the culprit and ensure his family’s safety, 17-year-old Emrik stationed himself near the entrance of the barn at nightfall, armed with a small dagger, a rusted pitchfork leaning next to him. His 12-year-old sister begged to accompany him, but she was made to go to her room as usual. Still, she kept watch by her window, working on a leather pouch to keep awake.  Suddenly, she caught sight of a movement in the shadows far across the property. It slunk towards the barn, but Emrik didn’t react; he had his back to it and hadn’t seen it yet. Unthinking, the girl ran out of the house and raced toward him, slipping on the muddy earth. She watched the two figures struggle; one fell, the other atop him. Instinctively, she grasped the tools in her nightshift’s pocket as she reached the pair. Screaming, she plunged them into the beast’s side. It reared back and stumbled away before collapsing.

She lifted her head as the moon emerged from behind its cloud, and in its glinting on the blood-soaked sterling sewing shears her mother had lent her, she saw reflected an unusual symbol.

Through the dicipline instilled in her through her study and training, Danori was well on her way to becoming a notable official in Alyfhil.

Divunquil, a half-elven god of peace, called out to her. He requested she aid him in reuniting the elves of the continent with the humans. Currently, the races were seperated by a bitter history of war. He told Danori that she must do all in her power to unify them.  Danori found herself inspired.

Danori went to her elders, the leaders of the Dalanthan family, hoping that perhaps they would support her in her cause.  She told them of her encounter with the leaders of Alyfhil. She explained her case, and she told them of Divunquil's message. Her elders were furious. Danori had suggested they reconcile with the humans in front of the leaders of their city? She had made a disgrace of the Dalanthan family. She was promptly disowned and turned away for her radical ideas.  Danori did not feel dismayed. She had been contacted by a God. She had a duty to fulfill. Perhaps Eiladronya was not as welcoming to her ideas as she would have liked. No matter, perhaps she must spread the word of Divunquil's goals elsewhere! Danori rounded up her gear and prepared to set out, bringing stories of Divunquil and of unity between the elves and humans with her. Despite the challenges she faces, Danori Dalanthan knows her faith will not be shaken.  Danori has spent the last few decades making her way south from Eiladronya towards Lothgard, where she hopes to make allies with human leaders that can help her in her quest at forging better relations between the humans and the elves. On her way, she spreads the word of Divunquil to those who will listen.  A few decades into her journey, while passing though the DMSP, Danori met a dwarven man who seemed to be looking to turn his life around. He stuck around her, saying he was helping keep her out of trouble. He's been a wonderful companion to Danori over the past few months as they made their way down to Lothgard. She's very happy to have his company.  Danori sees herself as a representative for Alyfhil and for Divunquil. She tries to set an example for what the relationship between the two races could be through her interactions with the humans."}]}

Their daughter Tesh spent her childhood in this idyllic setting, meeting interesting travelers, discovering rainbows and playing with adorable animals.  But of course a terrible tragedy lurked just around the corner, ready to disturb this perfect childhood...  ...because one day Mr. Sniggles went missing!! He was only a month old and -oh! He was her favorite and playful and just the cutest snuggliest little bird-guy ever!! Tesh experienced denial, anger and finally flopped onto the haystack in the barn loft, rendered immobile for hours by the depressing knowledge that she would never see Sniggles again (he hadn’t been seen for a whole 52 minutes, so she knew he must be DEAD).  Through her tears, she saw the sinking afternoon sun through the loft window.  Somewhere deep beneath the hopelessness she found a hidden resolve; she would throw every last ounce of energy in her eight-year-old body into finding him.  Random passersbys were conscripted into a search party to comb the town; just before the sun passed below the horizon, a shout went up from Cassowary Hill; Mr. Sniggles was found! He had hurt his leg climbing through a fence and was stuck.  Tesh cried with joy as she hugged Sniggles, and the town gathered in impromptu celebration.  Belatedly, she noticed that from their elevated position they could see a group of figures traveling across the plains in the distance.  “Daddy, who’re they?” Her father Tardin explained how the nearby settlement of Elves was marching to war against their ancient enemies, the Drow.  It took several more questions before she understood, with dawning horror, what he meant.  “You mean... people hurt each other... On purpose?!?”  Tesh was clearly about to cry again, so Tardin rushed to hug her, but was instead startled when her mood swung with a shout.  “I won’t let the Mr. Sniggles’ of the world be hurt by jerky old fences.  I promise to... teach them all to have fun, instead of being mean!”  Tardin Tara smiled in pride at his little girl... then rushed after her when he realized she was making a beeline for the Elves right now.  “Wait, no, you have to grow up first!”  Seventeen years later, she was ready.
