Believing himself simply ‘better’ than his human peers, he became something of a bully, demanding tributes and homework tips from his classmates.  After his schooling was complete, My’khal quickly rose through the ranks of coast-guardsmen of Puttum, demoralising his subordinates and, basically, abusing his power.  But when My’khal returned home one day to find his grandmother had died of exhaustion while furiously scrubbing graffiti from their door, he became shamed into learning better behaviour more suitable to his racial background. Messages along the lines of “go back to the sea giant michael” had been appearing daily, and yet his grandparents had attempted to always hide it from him out of a misguided sense of pride.  Immersing himself in the history of his family and the society of the sea elves, My’khal set out to undo the wrongs he’d caused and took an old battered coracle out to sea to visit the island of Gravett. He resolved to go by Giant Michael until he felt deserving of his birth name and made an oath to his grandfather that he would strive to protect the weak and innocent.  Three days into his journey, the coracle capsized when Giant Michael leaned overboard to pet a dolphin.

He was given a post as the watchman, scout, and guardian in charge of keeping the village safe. He did his job well, but the gargoyles the village had been at war with managed to find the one thing Erryt couldn’t see coming. They triggered a massive rockslide on the mountain, crushing the entire town and its inhabitants. Erryt saw no others escape the disaster, and his eyes “are as keen as they come! Keen as they come! BRAWK!” Seeing he was vastly outnumbered, Erryt fled, and has been on the wing for days, having just finally lost the last of the gargoyles chasing him.   \n1                                                   Real name !kãǂusa  Lives in fantasy Soviet Union, she and Valentina are an ethnic minority. Some Aarakocra came there a long time ago and learned reindeer herding from local tribesmen. The open sky suits their culture and mentality.    Grew up in a reindeer herding tribe far up north in the tundra. Went to university to become a healer-priest for her tribe. Met her girlfriend there, but her girlfriend Valentina (ʘalentao) went to fight in the Great Patriotic War. (Valentina is also an Aarakocra, but she and her family are from an Aarakocra neighbourhood in a city somewhere.)  The War lasted for 3 years. Now it has been two more years and Valentina has not come back yet. So Katyusha wanders with her dog, Maraka, to find her lost love.   Katyusha and Valentina had rings made together when Valentina left for the war. The gems in the rings glow faintly to let them know the other is alive and well. (The gem stops glowing if taken off their finger or if they die) However, it does not point to where they are, so there is no indicator other than local tales.   (Valentina probably got taken as a prisoner of war or something idk)   \n2     Surkiikri was firstborn of the ruling family of the Mistcliffs Aarakocran colony in Chult. Tradition, though not law, dictates that the noble title pass to the firstborn, but Surk was passed over for his younger sister, Krilahk, a far more charismatic leader. Surk initially turned to the monastery to hone his martial skills, but there he also found belonging in the simply life away from the headaches of responsibility.  When word came to the monastery of new rumors of a piece of the Rod of Seven Parts, Surk felt a deeply rooted sense of responsibility stir for the people he was born, if not chosen, to lead. He left his new home in search of this artifact with the blessing of his order going with him.   Surk lives a highly conflicted inner life. He is content, happy even, with his life as a monk, though he still feels keenly the sting of not being good enough in the eyes of the Elder Council. However, deeper still, lies the truth that he never wanted to be the tribal leader. He remembers the ascension of his sister to the throne with relief mingled with guilt.

Her father founded a theatre company known as the Church of the Bold, with the main attraction to the theatre being La Familia Veritas, a quintet consisting of his five children. Being the youngest, she played the harp in the quintet. Her father also a composer, and was known for writing many operas, plays, and operettas containing themes and characters that were against the totalitarian rule of the government they lived in. As she got older, she tried to argue with her father to be even more forceful with his messages, trying to make an active change and be a voice for the people. He was eventually found one night, having been beaten to death in an ally. He was so badly beaten that the only real way they had of identifying him was through a scar he had on his eyebrow. Knowing that the attack was most likely from the government trying to silence any kind of revolutionary movement, Desdemona decided to leave home in pursuit of some kind of cause to join. She was eventually picked up by a secret resistance group called the Scavengers, and began working as a spy for them.   \n2425                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Orphan   \n2426                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Varan is a prince of the ancient line of Vacra.

One day he came back from a hunt only to witness a dragon burning everyone he ever knew. He watched them burn and scream from a distance. Then the dragon flew North. He rushed to the camp but there were no survivors. He took up the Chief's Great sword, and ran north for days, tracking the dragon that slayed his people without cause. He eventually tracked that dragon into a large dessert and was captured by a band of dragon fetishists. After some time he had his heart removed from his chest, killing him instantly. He never got his Justice, nor did he honor his war band.   \n\n      Count  \n0       138  \n1       202  \n2       209  \n3        70  \n5        69  \n...     ...  \n2424    205  \n2425      1  \n2426     18  \n2427     62  \n2428    115  \n\n[2322 rows x 5 columns]","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Name</th>\n      <th>Race</th>\n      <th>Class</th>\n      <th>Backstory</th>\n      <th>Count</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>Erryt</td>\n      <td>Aarakocra</td>\n      <td>Ranger</td>\n      <td>Erryt, a 7 year-old Aarakocra with golden plumage, crest and wings tipped with crimson, quickly earned a reputation in his home village for being the keenest eye and sharpest shot in the community.

Katyusha and Valentina had rings made together when Valentina left for the war. The gems in the rings glow faintly to let them know the other is alive and well. (The gem stops glowing if taken off their finger or if they die) However, it does not point to where they are, so there is no indicator other than local tales.   (Valentina probably got taken as a prisoner of war or something idk)</td>\n      <td>202</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Surkiikri</td>\n      <td>Aarakocra</td>\n      <td>Monk</td>\n      <td>Surkiikri was firstborn of the ruling family of the Mistcliffs Aarakocran colony in Chult. Tradition, though not law, dictates that the noble title pass to the firstborn, but Surk was passed over for his younger sister, Krilahk, a far more charismatic leader. Surk initially turned to the monastery to hone his martial skills, but there he also found belonging in the simply life away from the headaches of responsibility.  When word came to the monastery of new rumors of a piece of the Rod of Seven Parts, Surk felt a deeply rooted sense of responsibility stir for the people he was born, if not chosen, to lead. He left his new home in search of this artifact with the blessing of his order going with him.   Surk lives a highly conflicted inner life. He is content, happy even, with his life as a monk, though he still feels keenly the sting of not being good enough in the eyes of the Elder Council. However, deeper still, lies the truth that he never wanted to be the tribal leader. He remembers the ascension of his sister to the throne with relief mingled with guilt. This conflict of desires churns underneath the generous and altruistic attitude Surk presents to the world.</td>\n      <td>209</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>Azriel</td>\n      <td>Aasamar</td>\n      <td>Paladin</td>\n      <td>He was raised the isles in a family of nobles who had close ties to the gods and there angelic guardians.

Being the youngest, she played the harp in the quintet. Her father also a composer, and was known for writing many operas, plays, and operettas containing themes and characters that were against the totalitarian rule of the government they lived in. As she got older, she tried to argue with her father to be even more forceful with his messages, trying to make an active change and be a voice for the people. He was eventually found one night, having been beaten to death in an ally. He was so badly beaten that the only real way they had of identifying him was through a scar he had on his eyebrow. Knowing that the attack was most likely from the government trying to silence any kind of revolutionary movement, Desdemona decided to leave home in pursuit of some kind of cause to join. She was eventually picked up by a secret resistance group called the Scavengers, and began working as a spy for them.</td>\n      <td>205</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2425</th>\n      <td>Dreyard Bloodfallen</td>\n      <td>Human</td>\n      <td>Wizard</td>\n      <td>Orphan</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2426</th>\n      <td>Varan al-Vacra</td>\n      <td>Human</td>\n      <td>Paladin/Warlock</td>\n      <td>Varan is a prince of the ancient line of Vacra.

                                         Backstory  Abaewin Toredas lives a hard life. Born in Nybor, then leaving as soon as he was 10, to a small town in the forest, he was already unfamiliar with his surroundings. Descended from fallen angels, he never truly fit in. All his life, people had ridiculed him because of his silver hair. They all said it was grey. Abaewin’s parents were never around, always leaving him to his own devices.When he was 20, he would wander in dark places. He didn’t realize they were dark, but it was a place where he could get some peace and quiet, away from other people.  One day, he saw a woman in the woods, and she seemed to be trying to hide in plain sight for some reason. He said “Hello”, and she jumped and said “How can you see me?”. Abaewin said “What do you mean? It’s not that dark, and you’re not trying to hide.” The woman responded “What do you mean not that dark? I can barely see! Oh… are you one of those people descended from fallen angels?” “Yes”, replied Abaewin, “But I don’t seem to have gotten anything out of it, other than my gray hair”. The woman said “My name’s Zinnoara Galantara, and I might be able to teach you a thing or two. You seem to need some guidance. Or education.” Abaewin responded “My parents aren’t around much… I guess I could learn from you.” (Abaewin wasn’t exactly street smart...) Abaewin stayed with Zinnoara for quite some time, hermited away in the woods. Because of this, he wanted more. He had tasted power, as a young child, and wanted his freedom once more. He wanted it all.  His parents died when he was gone, but he never found out, as he didn’t have any love for his parents, not understanding why they were never home. But they were good people, and a large group of Divs had stormed the town, slaughtering the whole thing. The Divs were evil, and knew that Abaewin’s parents were Peris. Abaewin took after his ancestors, though, instead of his parents. The fallen angels. If not for that, the Divs would have come long ago. However, if Abaewin had been there, he would have been killed. Anyways, Abaewin stayed and trained with Zinnoara for 50 years. His appearance didn’t change too much, but Zinnoara grew old and died. He learned much about the world he was in, but was just starting down the path of the arcane arts when Zinnoara died. He mourned her for quite some time, then left to find a new path for himself.   As he travelled, he came across a group of Sczarni. They adopted him into the family, thinking he was a normal human wizard, and he travelled with them for some time. They gifted him a pet, a small snake. Abaewen named it Meeka. 10 years later, Abaewin had learned much from his adopted family, including a few family friends in a town called Sandpoint. This turned out to be good, as one night, the family was attacked by bandits, and Abaewin was driven out, distracting the bandits long enough for the family to flee. Abaewin decided to travel to Sandpoint, as it was the only place he knew of where he could be safe. When he arrived at Sandpoint, he found the family friend, a ruthless thug named Jubrayl Vhiski at the Fatman’s Feedbag. Abaewin stayed at the Feedbag for 6 years, doing odd jobs around the place. During his stay, he learned about the locals, and a few tricks of the trade.   \n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Jas grew up in the city of Vier as the daughter of a dyer and a hunter of exotic beasts. Her parents were loving and her home cramped but comfortable. With both a keen sense of justice and uncommon size and strength from a young age, Jas spent a lot of her childhood beating up neighborhood bullies. Her peers regarded her with a mixture of fear and respect, the proportions of which varied depending on how likely they were to earn her ire. She didn’t make friends easily, and her clear divine heritage only increased her distance from the other children. Although she’s not naturally a solitary person, Jas learned to entertain herself, whether by reading history or honing her physical skills.  When she was 16, Jas chased down a burglar who had stolen from a neighbor and hit him so hard that, in the middle of a public street, he flew back and slammed into a wall. She didn't kill him, but it was frightening enough that she and her parents decided she should join the military to receive training and learn discipline.  The military suited Jas--she loved the hierarchy, the routine, the sense of doing what was right. As someone highly athletic, committed to following the rules, and with a commanding presence, she excelled. She spent ten years in the army, rising from teenage enlisted soldier to officer.  Just before her next promotion, however, a scandal broke. The country Vier is located in, Mohrany, used to be united with their neighbor, Sacreden. The Sacredi ambassador, it turned out, had been secretly gathering intelligence and compiling lists of Mohranian citizens who would be eligible for a draft (the draft is currently not in use in Mohrany, but used to be, and is highly controversial). When this was discovered, a fellow soldier got ahold of the information and anonymously leaked it to the public. This was illegal, a clear breach of the code of conduct and of confidentiality, and Jas worried that making public the treachery and subsequent embarrassment of a sometimes unfriendly ally would cause a war, one in which she or her fellow soldiers would be among the first to die. She took it upon herself to investigate, tracked down the whistleblower, and brought him up on charges in military court.  Then, in court, the goddess that Jas served as an aasimar and as a paladin--Cio, goddess of law, justice, and order--judged her to be in the wrong and cast her down, stripping her of her angelic powers. Jas fell.  Everything collapsed quickly after that. So publicly humiliated, Jas was quietly encouraged to leave the military, and she did. Her loss of faith in Cio, spurred by an inability to understand how a goddess of law could take the side of a lawbreaker over a devoted servant, caused her to lose her paladin powers. She spent a year and a half meandering through Vier's worst dive bars, drinking and getting into fights. She made a few friends, but more enemies.  Jas hit rock bottom when she realized there wasn't a bar in her rotation that she hadn't been kicked out of for fighting. She vowed to clean up her act, and spent time re-learning how to wield a sword without divine power behind it. Soon, she was good enough to look for jobs, and was eventually taken on by the Rana family, new nobility who didn't care about the optics of her past.  She's been working for the Ranas for a year now, and she likes them a lot, but recently she's begun to be suspicious of their adult son, Ere. Figuring out what he gets up to when he disappears might just lead her down a strange path.   \n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         One night Nissanai, an Iroran hermit dwelling in the Menador Mountains, gave shelter – and eventually other comforts – to a mysterious traveler who vanished from her tower the next morning, leaving no footprints in the snow. When she birthed fraternal triplets the following autumn she recognized them immediately for the Idyllkin that they were and felt their names whispered to her by the providence of the Heavenly realms. Recognizing both the great blessing and responsibility laid upon her, the lone sage set about raising the three girls in a manner befitting their heritage. She lay all of her learning as a scholar of the Master of Masters at their disposal and brought them up knowing endless learning and love.  Nissanai's efforts did not go to waste. The eldest cleaved to the holiness of her god, vowing to protect all good-hearted seekers of knowledge who crossed the treacherous mountain passes. The middle daughter focused on Irori's aspect of honorable self-perfection and enlightenment with a monk's dedication. Then there was Solveig, who was nothing like her sisters and like her mother least of all. For while she respected Irori, she had no patience for the Master of Masters' stern teachings; no patience for anything at all, really. The windy mountains in which she was born infused her with their power, but she had no interest in perfecting her magic through scholarly study. Worldly learning bored her no less. Indeed, the only non-fiction books in her mother's vast library that could hold her interest were military treatises and manuals on hand-to-hand combat, leaving her with a wide array of technical knowledge but little understanding of its practical application. Frequently coming up the loser in sparring matches with her more martially-rigorous sisters never curbed Solveig's enthusiasm, however. When Nissanai passed away at peace with the life she'd led, the girls each felt the blessing their mother had on the day of their birth. They knew the time had come to leave their mountain home and bring the good their mother had brought them up believing in to the troubled outside world. For her part, Solveig knows she is part of a great plan, but worries little about what her next move will be, preferring to let her journey happen as it happens. She rarely plans ahead, getting by on a mix of charm, guile, and bluster. She dresses impractically, flirts recklessly, and spends money without even thinking. She has used her magic to fortify her against the harsh climate of her home constantly rather than learn to cope with it practically, with the unintended side effect that her natural Celestial resistance against certain elements has atrophied away to nothing. But for all her flaws, her heart is pure and full of fearsome and protective love. She does not know what cause for which her Celestial father sired her, but she knows that when she finds it she will defend it with every last drop of her Agathion blood. At 5'11”, Solveig is taller than either of her sisters, with proportions improbable for one so slender. Despite her willowy build, her heavenly heritage endows her with unexpected speed, strength, and stamina. The white stripes on her skin are easily mistaken for body paint, but are in fact pigment as natural as the stripes of a zebra or tiger. Less subtle marks of her heritage are hair a shade of red not found in nature (which lightens to radiant blonde during times of heavy magic use) and eyes the color of electrum coins. Easily mistaken for a woman of low morals and social class, Solveig is more than happy to use her appearance to her advantage right up until the moment when her quarterstaff begins breaking greedy hands and knocking lecherous heads.   \n14    You don't want to hear about me. I'm not very interesting. I can do interesting things and say interesting things, but listening to me talk about me isn't very interesting. The interesting person you want to hear about is my mother.  You may know here. Well, not personally. But you might know her name. Amelia Grace, the Lady Scarlet, singer, mage, musician, magician, muse-gician. One of the most sought after performers in… in… I'm not sure. I don't do well with names and places. Some big, important… thingy.  Maybe the city. Maybe an empire. It's hard to remember, as I was very small at the time, so I would be unlikely to fully recall even if I hadn't had my head cut apart and put back together two or three or twenty five times.  It's very tingly. Kind of refreshing to feel the fresh air blowing over your thoughts.  Mother was not one to cling to fame and fortune with every fiber of her being like some people would. Her life was music and her life was magic, and sometimes when she had time her life was me.  She was always looking into new things, and old things, and old things that were so old that they had been forgotten about and thus had become new again. And one of these things was what would come to be called the Song of Life.  Said to be sung by the very gods themselves when they brought the world into being, through manipulation of the song one could change the growth of crops, affect the breeding of animals, make creatures grow faster, make them stronger, make them faster, make them tougher, make them different.  Make them never die.  Mother traced the echoes of the song, heard them in her dreams. Followed them to a temple in the middle of wilderness, buried beneath sand and soil of the centuries in a place where even the oldest writings say nothing about anyone ever having lived there.  And deep down in the dark, in that unspeakably ancient temple to an unspeakable being of unspeakable power who was unspeakably ancient when the gods were born, she drilled a teeny, tiny hole in reality and for a few brief moments heard something singing the Song itself. Not merely an echo.  She made the hole go away and fled the temple, never to return. Knowing to what extent the Song could be put to use.  But people were listening. Always listening. Trying to understand the echoes of the Song of Life.  So when they heard a few moments of actual singing they took advantage.  Just a little school of magic and music out in the countryside. Not particularly important. Not until they found that could keep things alive, keep them healthy, keep them from dying from old age indefinitely.  Learn how to Sing, learn the notes, the chords, the tones, the tempos to the Song of Life. Sing the right words in the right ways in the right keys and live forever. Sing it loud enough, sing it long enough, and no part of you dies.  There's a term for that. When bits of you that are supposed to die don't, when they keep on living when they shouldn't. It's called cancer. It is not a fun way to die. It is an even fun less way to remain alive.  And they couldn't stop. They had bettered themselves such that their bodies always sang the songs, forever to life, never to die.  And soon the song spread beyond them. Their mere presence making things grow, making things live, making things never die.  Illnesses are alive. Diseases are alive. Plagues are alive. The places in the world that are crammed to the brim with life, the grand cities, the fertile rainforests, they are places where contagions thrive.  Those who sought to never die screamed and wailed in their agonies as their bodies were consumed by virulent sickness. Healing, infecting, rotting, and healing again in an endless cycle of consumption.  Not even the slightest bit of them was allowed to die, not even one hair made to fall away from their heads. They grew, bloated, warped, twisted, becoming less beings and more locations, living rooms, buildings, factories of flesh and bone, belching forth abominations.  It was to this landscape of carnal horror that Mother returned to. And she purged it with fire. Purged it until the valley was glass.  Father was having troubles with the… king? Emperor? Duke? Count? Well, the thing pretending to be him. Some creature was wearing the old king's skin and hiding inside it. Father stayed behind, while Mother took me and we went away.  Away to a pretty little valley filled with simple farmers, remote wilderness, and narrow, easily watched canyons on either side as the sole entrance where she could place guardian beasts just in case the agents of the Skinmask King came calling.  And then one day they did. Once again in search of the Song of Life and its power. Wanting to make perfect soldiers. Immortal soldiers. Undying soldiers.  The King sent his blackest of knights, who slew my mother's dragon, came to the town, burned the town when Mother would not give them what they wanted.  And then Mother did.  Mother sang the Song of Life for them, and then the misty valley was no more.  It was no longer part of the world.  It was where She dwells. Not the composer of the song, but the singer. It's loudest, longest singer who has grown a world's chorus worth of voices in the eternities she has spent, cast between worlds. She was not supposed to live, but she could not die. So she simply was.  In an eternal emptiness there is infinite room to grow, where years are like seconds and seconds are like years.  She gave them what they wanted.  And they killed her for it.  Mother fought them, of course. And they died. And Mother died.  But She brought them back. To watch them. To study them. To experiment with them. Everyone, everything, animal, vegetable, and mineral in that valley.  She cut us apart, put us back together, saw how we worked with other parts. She was curious, wanting to learn. She didn't get new things to experiment on very often, and certainly not in such large numbers.  She found Mother the most interesting, and the most malleable. Mother was already filled with Her song, after all, and She could manipulate her almost as well as She could warp and twist Herself.  She could cut cut cut away the bad parts, keep us normal, make sure that we remained fully functional and intact even as she hacked us to pieces and put us back together.  After a few seconds and a few decades Mother had a moment of lucid clarity where her mind was her own and not merely an extension of She Who Thrives Between. Her body, however, was another story. She lifted me up, drilled a bigger hole in reality, and pushed me through, closing it upon the part of herself that was carrying me.  I left yesterday a little girl, and came back this morning as a grown… mmm, with all the changes, all the bestial alterations, would I still be classified as a woman, do you think? Perhaps if I had a few more scales and a bit more snout I would be called a grown dragoness.  I don't have my mother's gift for magic. I cannot cast spells, summon beasts, and bind creatures to my will as she did. And for this I am thankful, as it means that I cannot truly sing the Song of Life that can cause such horrors upon the world. I don't know the words.  I think Mother cut the words out of my head when she was taking me apart and putting me back together, made to act as a puppet with Her hand inside.  I can make living things listen to me, I can change them. I can make them dance to my tune.  Music can only suggest a mood, it takes words to state the way that something truly is.  I can't do that. I don't want to do that. I won't do that.  I will use the tune, but I'll be using my own lyrics, thank you very much.  Have you ever realized that you'd be really, really cute with a tail, by the way?  Here, let me show you...   \n19

small fishing village alone. Rarely was there a reason to pay them any attention and not worth the risk of angering the village's aquatic allies. The day Captain Harlot heard rumors of a small boy who could change the winds during a tantrum that he decided the reward was worth it. They found the boy easily enough playing on the docks. He was the only Half-Elf with blue hair and skin to be seen. With only minimal bloodshed, the pirates returned to the ship, the boys screams nearly causing the rowboat to capsize numerous times by conjures waves on a calm sea. Captain Harlot took him in and raised the boy as her own, treating him with all the love he could want, assuring him that she world protect him form all the mean pirates and convincing him that life with her was better than life in the fishing village. It was all a lie though. Captain Harlot had instructed the crew to torment the boy so she could play hero. She cultivated a loyal and strong and deadly sorcerer. Illithrian learned the truth when he was 16, when he overheard one of the old crew explaining to a new recruit the whole story. Illithrian set the ship on fire, rowboats and all.   He dove overboard and swam 3 miles to shore. He wandered, exhausted, into the nearest pub and ordered \"A whiskey on the roughest day of his life\" and kept drinking until someone bumped into him. He turned around, punching a massive Goliath right in the ribs. A bit offput by this tiny boy taking a swing at him, Momak hesitated until the boy decided to swing with a follow through. Illithrian was soundly beaten but before he went down he released a burst of thunderous force, knocking everyone around him back. Seeing potential in the kid, the captain of Momak's ship called the fight off and invited Illithrian aboard as a member of his crew. No strings attached, Illithrian freely offered his services to the crew, though to this day 2 years later he still thinks Momak is going to murder him in his sleep.   \n...

As a teenager, he was often rebellious and resentful of his strict upbringing. To get his son in line, his father sent him away to study under the Drunken Master. Huang was initiated into the Way of the Eight Drunken Immortals, and became adept in 7 of the 8 Drunken Fist styles. In the midst of a fight, he completed his training by creating his own unique style. He has become much more calm and gentle since then, although he is a heavy drinker now. Although he was brought up very traditionally, he is fascinated with Western culture and rejects his traditional upbringing. He often gave speeches against the government and his traditional way of life. Unable to get rid of him due to his father’s influence, Huang was sent to study in Pa Kyo, the Shou Fou capital of Western culture. Ironically, this only introduced him to the Pa Kyo Group, a study group that advocated overthrowing the government and living in an agrarian society. Huang put his Drunken Boxing skills to the test by acting as one of the groups bodyguards against attacks by police and other pro-government forces, often proving himself to be a one-man army. He continued to study and train every day, also sinking deeper into the lore of the Eight Immortals. He particularly came to revere Li Tieguai, and attempts to emulate him in his fighting for the rights of the poor and healing of the sick with potions he carries around with him. He returned home, more incensed than ever against the government and more sure of himself. Unable to tolerate his presence but unable to defeat him, the government finally exiled him. He has been traveling ever since, often disguising himself as a weak, drunken beggar, ostensibly out of humility but also to throw off enemies into thinking he is not dangerous. He carries a bamboo stick with an iron core and wears a large brass earring. He is very mischievous and loves to use pranks to make powerful people look foolish. In addition to a variety of weapons, he likes to make use of different objects as improvised weapons.   \n2364

Eldishfir, along with his brother, Mikhael. He had always had a certain inventiveness, and with the resources available to the son of such nobles, he was able to make outstanding things, such as a satchel that magically crafted several alchemical formulas of his own design by the age of 20. By the age of 25, Pyotr had already taken an apprentice, a young man by the name of Oskar Tazik. Pyotr was truly a man of science. One day, when Pyotr was 36, he had been working on a particularly volatile substance, when the mixture exploded, severely and permanently burning Pyotr, and killing Oskar. Pyotr’s father, not wanting to draw attention to an incident of manslaughter involving the son of a baron, made sure to sweep the entire event under the rug, and had Pyotr quietly put into prison. His mother had already passed away by this point. Despite the severity of the burns covering Pyotr’s upper body, he received only minimal medical help before being detained. Pyotr would spend the next 5 years in the prison, and in that time, he became acquainted with a man named Sergei. Sergei was an old medicine-man who was imprisoned for a reason Pyotr never discovered. Sergei showed Pyotr how to cope with the constant pain of such burns, as well as how to care for them. During his time in prison, he also developed some less than healthy ritualistic habits. When Pyotr was 41, his father passed away, and Mikhael became the baron. Mikhael decided that instead of keeping Pyotr imprisoned, he would have him banished from Eldishfir. Pyotr, while still altogether unhappy from the events of the past several years, experienced an increase in mood when he realized he would have the chance to travel the world, and especially that through this exile, he would be able to escape the confines of the prison, which functioned as a physical barrier between himself and his ability to invent. Having been banished from his homeland, and not very inclined to return, he decided to cast aside his real surname of Djokorov, and dubbed himself Pyotr Draguvarik. He is determined to live a new life, one rich with creativity, though he carries with him a reminder of what happened to cause all of this, both in the form of Oskar’s original application and in his nightmares. He just wants to get out into the world, to experience new places, meet new people, and to develop and imbibe new substances. Almost one year later, his real adventure would begin...    \n2381                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             After a night of drinking at another decrepit tavern Baridius lies sleeping in the stables, the dice were not kind tonight and he cannot afford a room within the inn itself. As always he has the same dream of the night which set him on his path. Originally an only child victimised by his peers Baridius spent his early years learning to talk his way out of trouble rather than to fight through it as he grew older this ability proved more and more necessary, for cheating drunks out of their money was rarely hazard free.   As always the dream starts at the Splendiferous Unicorn a rather fancy tavern for the likes of Baridius with an entrance fee to match, it had taken several months for him to scavenge the money in cheated chance games and stolen pocket change but at last here he sat on a fine leather seat in a darkened corner reviewing the marks that lay before him. As he waits looking for the right target a darkened hair drow woman enters the establishment accompanied by a muscular half orc dressed in fine leather clothes. Baridus observes the woman move from game to game, collecting more and more winnings, as she travels through the tavern. Most importantly he notices that every game she plays at she offers no bet and mutters only a few words to her opponent at the beginning of the game before falling into silence until her victory. Interest peaked Baridius approaches.  Placing his trusted weighted dice on the table Baridus smiles at the woman mustering all of his charm “I must admit I’m interested in your coin but notice you have yet to bet anytime” the drow meets his gaze “quite the contrary best me and I shall grant you your heart’s desire.” While normally a man highly resistant to false promises, after making so many himself, there was something about this particular offer that consumed Baridius sitting at the table he and the drow rolled their die and as his weighted luck would have it Baridius emerged the winner, however in his greed he had forgotten the first rule of conning, always let the loser feel like they have won. The drow smiled placed a kiss on Baridius’ cheek and departed from the tavern.   Always at the kiss Baridius wakes startled but that night was only the beginning of his tale, as the days went on Baridius noticed stranger and stranger occurrences around him, flames would burst into life or ebb into darkness as he passed by, earth and dirt would sometimes ripple like water when he stood upon it and people whom once hated seemed more content within his presence. At first this came as a blessing, these small benefits, it was not until the next bar brawl when everything changed, using his new found powers Baridius attempted to subdue his opponent when something went horribly wrong. An uncontrollable cascade of fire erupted over Baridius’ head engulfing all within the tavern, including himself, in flame, to this day Baridius does not know how he survived this, but he did and woke up charred, burned and coughing up ash hours later in the broken wreckage of the tavern. Now fleeing from his past, and seeking redemption, Baridius roams the world searching for the drow and the answers that she may hold.   \n2382                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Danori hails from Alyfhil, the captial of Eiladronya. There, she grew up in the noble Dalanthan family, where she spent her formative years studying the world and it's people through books. Of all the accounts she read, she found that the elves, and most notably the Eladrin, were superior. She also trained in combat, becoming a prodigious swordsman. Through the dicipline instilled in her through her study and training, Danori was well on her way to becoming a notable official in Alyfhil.  With just weeks to go until an important test of her knowledge to further her career, Danori was studying in one of the libraries of Alyfhil. Her eyes crossed to a book about the Gods of Aefdron, and she decided it might be interesting to read. She flipped open the book to a page right in the middle, and she recieved a vision.  Divunquil, a half-elven god of peace, called out to her. He requested she aid him in reuniting the elves of the continent with the humans. Currently, the races were seperated by a bitter history of war. He told Danori that she must do all in her power to unify them.  Danori found herself inspired. A god had given her a great task, and she knew she must make the effort to achieve it. Using her rising position and upcoming examination, Danori went to the leaders of Alyfhil. She told them Divunquil's message and asked for their assistance in achieving his goals. Put nicely, Danori was laughed out of the room. She had doomed her political career. What self-respecting Eladrin would willing associate with the humans? The humans were barbaric, they said.  Danori had seen the truth, though. She believed in Divunquil's word. Danori went to her elders, the leaders of the Dalanthan family, hoping that perhaps they would support her in her cause.  She told them of her encounter with the leaders of Alyfhil. She explained her case, and she told them of Divunquil's message. Her elders were furious. Danori had suggested they reconcile with the humans in front of the leaders of their city? She had made a disgrace of the Dalanthan family. She was promptly disowned and turned away for her radical ideas.  Danori did not feel dismayed. She had been contacted by a God. She had a duty to fulfill. Perhaps Eiladronya was not as welcoming to her ideas as she would have liked. No matter, perhaps she must spread the word of Divunquil's goals elsewhere! Danori rounded up her gear and prepared to set out, bringing stories of Divunquil and of unity between the elves and humans with her. Despite the challenges she faces, Danori Dalanthan knows her faith will not be shaken.  Danori has spent the last few decades making her way south from Eiladronya towards Lothgard, where she hopes to make allies with human leaders that can help her in her quest at forging better relations between the humans and the elves. On her way, she spreads the word of Divunquil to those who will listen.  A few decades into her journey, while passing though the DMSP, Danori met a dwarven man who seemed to be looking to turn his life around. He stuck around her, saying he was helping keep her out of trouble. He's been a wonderful companion to Danori over the past few months as they made their way down to Lothgard. She's very happy to have his company.  Danori sees herself as a representative for Alyfhil and for Divunquil. She tries to set an example for what the relationship between the two races could be through her interactions with the humans.   \n2383                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                On the sunny plains to the South lies a small rural village named Giprol, where the Aimar and Tardin Tara own a modest Chocobo™ farm.  Their daughter Tesh spent her childhood in this idyllic setting, meeting interesting travelers, discovering rainbows and playing with adorable animals.  But of course a terrible tragedy lurked just around the corner, ready to disturb this perfect childhood...  ...because one day Mr. Sniggles went missing!! He was only a month old and -oh! He was her favorite and playful and just the cutest snuggliest little bird-guy ever!! Tesh experienced denial, anger and finally flopped onto the haystack in the barn loft, rendered immobile for hours by the depressing knowledge that she would never see Sniggles again (he hadn’t been seen for a whole 52 minutes, so she knew he must be DEAD).  Through her tears, she saw the sinking afternoon sun through the loft window.  Somewhere deep beneath the hopelessness she found a hidden resolve; she would throw every last ounce of energy in her eight-year-old body into finding him.  Random passersbys were conscripted into a search party to comb the town; just before the sun passed below the horizon, a shout went up from Cassowary Hill; Mr. Sniggles was found! He had hurt his leg climbing through a fence and was stuck.  Tesh cried with joy as she hugged Sniggles, and the town gathered in impromptu celebration.  Belatedly, she noticed that from their elevated position they could see a group of figures traveling across the plains in the distance.  “Daddy, who’re they?” Her father Tardin explained how the nearby settlement of Elves was marching to war against their ancient enemies, the Drow.  It took several more questions before she understood, with dawning horror, what he meant.  “You mean... people hurt each other... On purpose?!?”  Tesh was clearly about to cry again, so Tardin rushed to hug her, but was instead startled when her mood swung with a shout.  “I won’t let the Mr. Sniggles’ of the world be hurt by jerky old fences.  I promise to... teach them all to have fun, instead of being mean!”  Tardin Tara smiled in pride at his little girl... then rushed after her when he realized she was making a beeline for the Elves right now.  “Wait, no, you have to grow up first!”  Seventeen years later, she was ready.

Born in Nybor, then leaving as soon as he was 10, to a small town in the forest, he was already unfamiliar with his surroundings. Descended from fallen angels, he never truly fit in. All his life, people had ridiculed him because of his silver hair. They all said it was grey. Abaewin’s parents were never around, always leaving him to his own devices.When he was 20, he would wander in dark places. He didn’t realize they were dark, but it was a place where he could get some peace and quiet, away from other people.  One day, he saw a woman in the woods, and she seemed to be trying to hide in plain sight for some reason. He said “Hello”, and she jumped and said “How can you see me?”. Abaewin said “What do you mean? It’s not that dark, and you’re not trying to hide.” The woman responded “What do you mean not that dark? I can barely see! Oh… are you one of those people descended from fallen angels?” “Yes”, replied Abaewin, “But I don’t seem to have gotten anything out of it, other than my gray hair”. The woman said “My name’s Zinnoara Galantara, and I might be able to teach you a thing or two. You seem to need some guidance. Or education.” Abaewin responded “My parents aren’t around much… I guess I could learn from you.” (Abaewin wasn’t exactly street smart...) Abaewin stayed with Zinnoara for quite some time, hermited away in the woods. Because of this, he wanted more. He had tasted power, as a young child, and wanted his freedom once more. He wanted it all.  His parents died when he was gone, but he never found out, as he didn’t have any love for his parents, not understanding why they were never home. But they were good people, and a large group of Divs had stormed the town, slaughtering the whole thing. The Divs were evil, and knew that Abaewin’s parents were Peris. Abaewin took after his ancestors, though, instead of his parents. The fallen angels. If not for that, the Divs would have come long ago. However, if Abaewin had been there, he would have been killed. Anyways, Abaewin stayed and trained with Zinnoara for 50 years. His appearance didn’t change too much, but Zinnoara grew old and died. He learned much about the world he was in, but was just starting down the path of the arcane arts when Zinnoara died. He mourned her for quite some time, then left to find a new path for himself.   As he travelled, he came across a group of Sczarni. They adopted him into the family, thinking he was a normal human wizard, and he travelled with them for some time. They gifted him a pet, a small snake. Abaewen named it Meeka. 10 years later, Abaewin had learned much from his adopted family, including a few family friends in a town called Sandpoint. This turned out to be good, as one night, the family was attacked by bandits, and Abaewin was driven out, distracting the bandits long enough for the family to flee. Abaewin decided to travel to Sandpoint, as it was the only place he knew of where he could be safe. When he arrived at Sandpoint, he found the family friend, a ruthless thug named Jubrayl Vhiski at the Fatman’s Feedbag. Abaewin stayed at the Feedbag for 6 years, doing odd jobs around the place. During his stay, he learned about the locals, and a few tricks of the trade.</td>\n      <td>599</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12</th>\n      <td>Jasna Bek</td>\n      <td>aasimar</td>\n      <td>fighter</td>\n      <td>Jas grew up in the city of Vier as the daughter of a dyer and a hunter of exotic beasts. Her parents were loving and her home cramped but comfortable. With both a keen sense of justice and uncommon size and strength from a young age, Jas spent a lot of her childhood beating up neighborhood bullies. Her peers regarded her with a mixture of fear and respect, the proportions of which varied depending on how likely they were to earn her ire. She didn’t make friends easily, and her clear divine heritage only increased her distance from the other children. Although she’s not naturally a solitary person, Jas learned to entertain herself, whether by reading history or honing her physical skills.  When she was 16, Jas chased down a burglar who had stolen from a neighbor and hit him so hard that, in the middle of a public street, he flew back and slammed into a wall. She didn't kill him, but it was frightening enough that she and her parents decided she should join the military to receive training and learn discipline.  The military suited Jas--she loved the hierarchy, the routine, the sense of doing what was right. As someone highly athletic, committed to following the rules, and with a commanding presence, she excelled. She spent ten years in the army, rising from teenage enlisted soldier to officer.  Just before her next promotion, however, a scandal broke. The country Vier is located in, Mohrany, used to be united with their neighbor, Sacreden. The Sacredi ambassador, it turned out, had been secretly gathering intelligence and compiling lists of Mohranian citizens who would be eligible for a draft (the draft is currently not in use in Mohrany, but used to be, and is highly controversial). When this was discovered, a fellow soldier got ahold of the information and anonymously leaked it to the public. This was illegal, a clear breach of the code of conduct and of confidentiality, and Jas worried that making public the treachery and subsequent embarrassment of a sometimes unfriendly ally would cause a war, one in which she or her fellow soldiers would be among the first to die. She took it upon herself to investigate, tracked down the whistleblower, and brought him up on charges in military court.  Then, in court, the goddess that Jas served as an aasimar and as a paladin--Cio, goddess of law, justice, and order--judged her to be in the wrong and cast her down, stripping her of her angelic powers. Jas fell.  Everything collapsed quickly after that. So publicly humiliated, Jas was quietly encouraged to leave the military, and she did. Her loss of faith in Cio, spurred by an inability to understand how a goddess of law could take the side of a lawbreaker over a devoted servant, caused her to lose her paladin powers. She spent a year and a half meandering through Vier's worst dive bars, drinking and getting into fights. She made a few friends, but more enemies.  Jas hit rock bottom when she realized there wasn't a bar in her rotation that she hadn't been kicked out of for fighting. She vowed to clean up her act, and spent time re-learning how to wield a sword without divine power behind it. Soon, she was good enough to look for jobs, and was eventually taken on by the Rana family, new nobility who didn't care about the optics of her past.  She's been working for the Ranas for a year now, and she likes them a lot, but recently she's begun to be suspicious of their adult son, Ere. Figuring out what he gets up to when he disappears might just lead her down a strange path.</td>\n      <td>621</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>13</th>\n      <td>Solveig</td>\n      <td>aasimar</td>\n      <td>sorcerer</td>\n      <td>One night Nissanai, an Iroran hermit dwelling in the Menador Mountains, gave shelter – and eventually other comforts – to a mysterious traveler who vanished from her tower the next morning, leaving no footprints in the snow. When she birthed fraternal triplets the following autumn she recognized them immediately for the Idyllkin that they were and felt their names whispered to her by the providence of the Heavenly realms. Recognizing both the great blessing and responsibility laid upon her, the lone sage set about raising the three girls in a manner befitting their heritage. She lay all of her learning as a scholar of the Master of Masters at their disposal and brought them up knowing endless learning and love.  Nissanai's efforts did not go to waste. The eldest cleaved to the holiness of her god, vowing to protect all good-hearted seekers of knowledge who crossed the treacherous mountain passes. The middle daughter focused on Irori's aspect of honorable self-perfection and enlightenment with a monk's dedication. Then there was Solveig, who was nothing like her sisters and like her mother least of all. For while she respected Irori, she had no patience for the Master of Masters' stern teachings; no patience for anything at all, really. The windy mountains in which she was born infused her with their power, but she had no interest in perfecting her magic through scholarly study. Worldly learning bored her no less. Indeed, the only non-fiction books in her mother's vast library that could hold her interest were military treatises and manuals on hand-to-hand combat, leaving her with a wide array of technical knowledge but little understanding of its practical application. Frequently coming up the loser in sparring matches with her more martially-rigorous sisters never curbed Solveig's enthusiasm, however. When Nissanai passed away at peace with the life she'd led, the girls each felt the blessing their mother had on the day of their birth. They knew the time had come to leave their mountain home and bring the good their mother had brought them up believing in to the troubled outside world. For her part, Solveig knows she is part of a great plan, but worries little about what her next move will be, preferring to let her journey happen as it happens. She rarely plans ahead, getting by on a mix of charm, guile, and bluster. She dresses impractically, flirts recklessly, and spends money without even thinking. She has used her magic to fortify her against the harsh climate of her home constantly rather than learn to cope with it practically, with the unintended side effect that her natural Celestial resistance against certain elements has atrophied away to nothing. But for all her flaws, her heart is pure and full of fearsome and protective love. She does not know what cause for which her Celestial father sired her, but she knows that when she finds it she will defend it with every last drop of her Agathion blood. At 5'11”, Solveig is taller than either of her sisters, with proportions improbable for one so slender. Despite her willowy build, her heavenly heritage endows her with unexpected speed, strength, and stamina. The white stripes on her skin are easily mistaken for body paint, but are in fact pigment as natural as the stripes of a zebra or tiger. Less subtle marks of her heritage are hair a shade of red not found in nature (which lightens to radiant blonde during times of heavy magic use) and eyes the color of electrum coins. Easily mistaken for a woman of low morals and social class, Solveig is more than happy to use her appearance to her advantage right up until the moment when her quarterstaff begins breaking greedy hands and knocking lecherous heads.</td>\n      <td>627</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>14</th>\n      <td>Lydia Fallon</td>\n      <td>aasimar</td>\n      <td>bard</td>\n      <td>You don't want to hear about me. I'm not very interesting. I can do interesting things and say interesting things, but listening to me talk about me isn't very interesting. The interesting person you want to hear about is my mother.  You may know here. Well, not personally. But you might know her name. Amelia Grace, the Lady Scarlet, singer, mage, musician, magician, muse-gician. One of the most sought after performers in… in… I'm not sure. I don't do well with names and places. Some big, important… thingy.  Maybe the city. Maybe an empire. It's hard to remember, as I was very small at the time, so I would be unlikely to fully recall even if I hadn't had my head cut apart and put back together two or three or twenty five times.  It's very tingly. Kind of refreshing to feel the fresh air blowing over your thoughts.  Mother was not one to cling to fame and fortune with every fiber of her being like some people would. Her life was music and her life was magic, and sometimes when she had time her life was me.  She was always looking into new things, and old things, and old things that were so old that they had been forgotten about and thus had become new again. And one of these things was what would come to be called the Song of Life.  Said to be sung by the very gods themselves when they brought the world into being, through manipulation of the song one could change the growth of crops, affect the breeding of animals, make creatures grow faster, make them stronger, make them faster, make them tougher, make them different.  Make them never die.  Mother traced the echoes of the song, heard them in her dreams. Followed them to a temple in the middle of wilderness, buried beneath sand and soil of the centuries in a place where even the oldest writings say nothing about anyone ever having lived there.  And deep down in the dark, in that unspeakably ancient temple to an unspeakable being of unspeakable power who was unspeakably ancient when the gods were born, she drilled a teeny, tiny hole in reality and for a few brief moments heard something singing the Song itself. Not merely an echo.  She made the hole go away and fled the temple, never to return. Knowing to what extent the Song could be put to use.  But people were listening. Always listening. Trying to understand the echoes of the Song of Life.  So when they heard a few moments of actual singing they took advantage.  Just a little school of magic and music out in the countryside. Not particularly important. Not until they found that could keep things alive, keep them healthy, keep them from dying from old age indefinitely.  Learn how to Sing, learn the notes, the chords, the tones, the tempos to the Song of Life. Sing the right words in the right ways in the right keys and live forever. Sing it loud enough, sing it long enough, and no part of you dies.  There's a term for that. When bits of you that are supposed to die don't, when they keep on living when they shouldn't. It's called cancer. It is not a fun way to die. It is an even fun less way to remain alive.  And they couldn't stop. They had bettered themselves such that their bodies always sang the songs, forever to life, never to die.  And soon the song spread beyond them. Their mere presence making things grow, making things live, making things never die.  Illnesses are alive. Diseases are alive. Plagues are alive. The places in the world that are crammed to the brim with life, the grand cities, the fertile rainforests, they are places where contagions thrive.  Those who sought to never die screamed and wailed in their agonies as their bodies were consumed by virulent sickness. Healing, infecting, rotting, and healing again in an endless cycle of consumption.  Not even the slightest bit of them was allowed to die, not even one hair made to fall away from their heads. They grew, bloated, warped, twisted, becoming less beings and more locations, living rooms, buildings, factories of flesh and bone, belching forth abominations.  It was to this landscape of carnal horror that Mother returned to. And she purged it with fire. Purged it until the valley was glass.  Father was having troubles with the… king? Emperor? Duke? Count? Well, the thing pretending to be him. Some creature was wearing the old king's skin and hiding inside it. Father stayed behind, while Mother took me and we went away.  Away to a pretty little valley filled with simple farmers, remote wilderness, and narrow, easily watched canyons on either side as the sole entrance where she could place guardian beasts just in case the agents of the Skinmask King came calling.  And then one day they did. Once again in search of the Song of Life and its power. Wanting to make perfect soldiers. Immortal soldiers. Undying soldiers.  The King sent his blackest of knights, who slew my mother's dragon, came to the town, burned the town when Mother would not give them what they wanted.  And then Mother did.  Mother sang the Song of Life for them, and then the misty valley was no more.  It was no longer part of the world.  It was where She dwells. Not the composer of the song, but the singer. It's loudest, longest singer who has grown a world's chorus worth of voices in the eternities she has spent, cast between worlds. She was not supposed to live, but she could not die. So she simply was.  In an eternal emptiness there is infinite room to grow, where years are like seconds and seconds are like years.  She gave them what they wanted.  And they killed her for it.  Mother fought them, of course. And they died. And Mother died.  But She brought them back. To watch them. To study them. To experiment with them. Everyone, everything, animal, vegetable, and mineral in that valley.  She cut us apart, put us back together, saw how we worked with other parts. She was curious, wanting to learn. She didn't get new things to experiment on very often, and certainly not in such large numbers.  She found Mother the most interesting, and the most malleable. Mother was already filled with Her song, after all, and She could manipulate her almost as well as She could warp and twist Herself.  She could cut cut cut away the bad parts, keep us normal, make sure that we remained fully functional and intact even as she hacked us to pieces and put us back together.  After a few seconds and a few decades Mother had a moment of lucid clarity where her mind was her own and not merely an extension of She Who Thrives Between. Her body, however, was another story. She lifted me up, drilled a bigger hole in reality, and pushed me through, closing it upon the part of herself that was carrying me.  I left yesterday a little girl, and came back this morning as a grown… mmm, with all the changes, all the bestial alterations, would I still be classified as a woman, do you think? Perhaps if I had a few more scales and a bit more snout I would be called a grown dragoness.  I don't have my mother's gift for magic. I cannot cast spells, summon beasts, and bind creatures to my will as she did. And for this I am thankful, as it means that I cannot truly sing the Song of Life that can cause such horrors upon the world. I don't know the words.  I think Mother cut the words out of my head when she was taking me apart and putting me back together, made to act as a puppet with Her hand inside.  I can make living things listen to me, I can change them. I can make them dance to my tune.  Music can only suggest a mood, it takes words to state the way that something truly is.  I can't do that. I don't want to do that. I won't do that.  I will use the tune, but I'll be using my own lyrics, thank you very much.

Rarely was there a reason to pay them any attention and not worth the risk of angering the village's aquatic allies. The day Captain Harlot heard rumors of a small boy who could change the winds during a tantrum that he decided the reward was worth it. They found the boy easily enough playing on the docks. He was the only Half-Elf with blue hair and skin to be seen. With only minimal bloodshed, the pirates returned to the ship, the boys screams nearly causing the rowboat to capsize numerous times by conjures waves on a calm sea. Captain Harlot took him in and raised the boy as her own, treating him with all the love he could want, assuring him that she world protect him form all the mean pirates and convincing him that life with her was better than life in the fishing village. It was all a lie though. Captain Harlot had instructed the crew to torment the boy so she could play hero. She cultivated a loyal and strong and deadly sorcerer. Illithrian learned the truth when he was 16, when he overheard one of the old crew explaining to a new recruit the whole story. Illithrian set the ship on fire, rowboats and all.   He dove overboard and swam 3 miles to shore. He wandered, exhausted, into the nearest pub and ordered \"A whiskey on the roughest day of his life\" and kept drinking until someone bumped into him. He turned around, punching a massive Goliath right in the ribs. A bit offput by this tiny boy taking a swing at him, Momak hesitated until the boy decided to swing with a follow through. Illithrian was soundly beaten but before he went down he released a burst of thunderous force, knocking everyone around him back. Seeing potential in the kid, the captain of Momak's ship called the fight off and invited Illithrian aboard as a member of his crew. No strings attached, Illithrian freely offered his services to the crew, though to this day 2 years later he still thinks Momak is going to murder him in his sleep.</td>\n      <td>362</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2361</th>\n      <td>Stevie Fei Hung</td>\n      <td>human</td>\n      <td>monk</td>\n      <td>Stevie Fei Huang, is the son of wealthy Shou Fou factory owner. As a teenager, he was often rebellious and resentful of his strict upbringing. To get his son in line, his father sent him away to study under the Drunken Master. Huang was initiated into the Way of the Eight Drunken Immortals, and became adept in 7 of the 8 Drunken Fist styles. In the midst of a fight, he completed his training by creating his own unique style. He has become much more calm and gentle since then, although he is a heavy drinker now. Although he was brought up very traditionally, he is fascinated with Western culture and rejects his traditional upbringing. He often gave speeches against the government and his traditional way of life. Unable to get rid of him due to his father’s influence, Huang was sent to study in Pa Kyo, the Shou Fou capital of Western culture. Ironically, this only introduced him to the Pa Kyo Group, a study group that advocated overthrowing the government and living in an agrarian society. Huang put his Drunken Boxing skills to the test by acting as one of the groups bodyguards against attacks by police and other pro-government forces, often proving himself to be a one-man army. He continued to study and train every day, also sinking deeper into the lore of the Eight Immortals. He particularly came to revere Li Tieguai, and attempts to emulate him in his fighting for the rights of the poor and healing of the sick with potions he carries around with him. He returned home, more incensed than ever against the government and more sure of himself. Unable to tolerate his presence but unable to defeat him, the government finally exiled him. He has been traveling ever since, often disguising himself as a weak, drunken beggar, ostensibly out of humility but also to throw off enemies into thinking he is not dangerous. He carries a bamboo stick with an iron core and wears a large brass earring. He is very mischievous and loves to use pranks to make powerful people look foolish. In addition to a variety of weapons, he likes to make use of different objects as improvised weapons.</td>\n      <td>370</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2364</th>\n      <td>Pyotr Djokorov</td>\n      <td>human</td>\n      <td>artificer</td>\n      <td>Pyotr Djokorov was born to Rasmus and Johanneke Djokorov, a Baron and Baroness in Eldishfir, along with his brother, Mikhael. He had always had a certain inventiveness, and with the resources available to the son of such nobles, he was able to make outstanding things, such as a satchel that magically crafted several alchemical formulas of his own design by the age of 20. By the age of 25, Pyotr had already taken an apprentice, a young man by the name of Oskar Tazik. Pyotr was truly a man of science. One day, when Pyotr was 36, he had been working on a particularly volatile substance, when the mixture exploded, severely and permanently burning Pyotr, and killing Oskar. Pyotr’s father, not wanting to draw attention to an incident of manslaughter involving the son of a baron, made sure to sweep the entire event under the rug, and had Pyotr quietly put into prison. His mother had already passed away by this point. Despite the severity of the burns covering Pyotr’s upper body, he received only minimal medical help before being detained. Pyotr would spend the next 5 years in the prison, and in that time, he became acquainted with a man named Sergei. Sergei was an old medicine-man who was imprisoned for a reason Pyotr never discovered. Sergei showed Pyotr how to cope with the constant pain of such burns, as well as how to care for them. During his time in prison, he also developed some less than healthy ritualistic habits. When Pyotr was 41, his father passed away, and Mikhael became the baron. Mikhael decided that instead of keeping Pyotr imprisoned, he would have him banished from Eldishfir. Pyotr, while still altogether unhappy from the events of the past several years, experienced an increase in mood when he realized he would have the chance to travel the world, and especially that through this exile, he would be able to escape the confines of the prison, which functioned as a physical barrier between himself and his ability to invent. Having been banished from his homeland, and not very inclined to return, he decided to cast aside his real surname of Djokorov, and dubbed himself Pyotr Draguvarik. He is determined to live a new life, one rich with creativity, though he carries with him a reminder of what happened to cause all of this, both in the form of Oskar’s original application and in his nightmares. He just wants to get out into the world, to experience new places, meet new people, and to develop and imbibe new substances.

As always he has the same dream of the night which set him on his path. Originally an only child victimised by his peers Baridius spent his early years learning to talk his way out of trouble rather than to fight through it as he grew older this ability proved more and more necessary, for cheating drunks out of their money was rarely hazard free.   As always the dream starts at the Splendiferous Unicorn a rather fancy tavern for the likes of Baridius with an entrance fee to match, it had taken several months for him to scavenge the money in cheated chance games and stolen pocket change but at last here he sat on a fine leather seat in a darkened corner reviewing the marks that lay before him. As he waits looking for the right target a darkened hair drow woman enters the establishment accompanied by a muscular half orc dressed in fine leather clothes. Baridus observes the woman move from game to game, collecting more and more winnings, as she travels through the tavern. Most importantly he notices that every game she plays at she offers no bet and mutters only a few words to her opponent at the beginning of the game before falling into silence until her victory. Interest peaked Baridius approaches.  Placing his trusted weighted dice on the table Baridus smiles at the woman mustering all of his charm “I must admit I’m interested in your coin but notice you have yet to bet anytime” the drow meets his gaze “quite the contrary best me and I shall grant you your heart’s desire.” While normally a man highly resistant to false promises, after making so many himself, there was something about this particular offer that consumed Baridius sitting at the table he and the drow rolled their die and as his weighted luck would have it Baridius emerged the winner, however in his greed he had forgotten the first rule of conning, always let the loser feel like they have won. The drow smiled placed a kiss on Baridius’ cheek and departed from the tavern.   Always at the kiss Baridius wakes startled but that night was only the beginning of his tale, as the days went on Baridius noticed stranger and stranger occurrences around him, flames would burst into life or ebb into darkness as he passed by, earth and dirt would sometimes ripple like water when he stood upon it and people whom once hated seemed more content within his presence. At first this came as a blessing, these small benefits, it was not until the next bar brawl when everything changed, using his new found powers Baridius attempted to subdue his opponent when something went horribly wrong. An uncontrollable cascade of fire erupted over Baridius’ head engulfing all within the tavern, including himself, in flame, to this day Baridius does not know how he survived this, but he did and woke up charred, burned and coughing up ash hours later in the broken wreckage of the tavern. Now fleeing from his past, and seeking redemption, Baridius roams the world searching for the drow and the answers that she may hold.</td>\n      <td>559</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2382</th>\n      <td>Danori Dalanthan</td>\n      <td>eladrin</td>\n      <td>paladin</td>\n      <td>Danori hails from Alyfhil, the captial of Eiladronya. There, she grew up in the noble Dalanthan family, where she spent her formative years studying the world and it's people through books. Of all the accounts she read, she found that the elves, and most notably the Eladrin, were superior. She also trained in combat, becoming a prodigious swordsman. Through the dicipline instilled in her through her study and training, Danori was well on her way to becoming a notable official in Alyfhil.  With just weeks to go until an important test of her knowledge to further her career, Danori was studying in one of the libraries of Alyfhil. Her eyes crossed to a book about the Gods of Aefdron, and she decided it might be interesting to read. She flipped open the book to a page right in the middle, and she recieved a vision.  Divunquil, a half-elven god of peace, called out to her. He requested she aid him in reuniting the elves of the continent with the humans. Currently, the races were seperated by a bitter history of war. He told Danori that she must do all in her power to unify them.  Danori found herself inspired. A god had given her a great task, and she knew she must make the effort to achieve it. Using her rising position and upcoming examination, Danori went to the leaders of Alyfhil. She told them Divunquil's message and asked for their assistance in achieving his goals. Put nicely, Danori was laughed out of the room. She had doomed her political career. What self-respecting Eladrin would willing associate with the humans? The humans were barbaric, they said.  Danori had seen the truth, though. She believed in Divunquil's word. Danori went to her elders, the leaders of the Dalanthan family, hoping that perhaps they would support her in her cause.  She told them of her encounter with the leaders of Alyfhil. She explained her case, and she told them of Divunquil's message. Her elders were furious. Danori had suggested they reconcile with the humans in front of the leaders of their city? She had made a disgrace of the Dalanthan family. She was promptly disowned and turned away for her radical ideas.  Danori did not feel dismayed. She had been contacted by a God. She had a duty to fulfill. Perhaps Eiladronya was not as welcoming to her ideas as she would have liked. No matter, perhaps she must spread the word of Divunquil's goals elsewhere! Danori rounded up her gear and prepared to set out, bringing stories of Divunquil and of unity between the elves and humans with her. Despite the challenges she faces, Danori Dalanthan knows her faith will not be shaken.  Danori has spent the last few decades making her way south from Eiladronya towards Lothgard, where she hopes to make allies with human leaders that can help her in her quest at forging better relations between the humans and the elves. On her way, she spreads the word of Divunquil to those who will listen.  A few decades into her journey, while passing though the DMSP, Danori met a dwarven man who seemed to be looking to turn his life around. He stuck around her, saying he was helping keep her out of trouble. He's been a wonderful companion to Danori over the past few months as they made their way down to Lothgard. She's very happy to have his company.  Danori sees herself as a representative for Alyfhil and for Divunquil. She tries to set an example for what the relationship between the two races could be through her interactions with the humans.</td>\n      <td>606</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2383</th>\n      <td>Tesh Tara</td>\n      <td>half-elf</td>\n      <td>paladin</td>\n      <td>On the sunny plains to the South lies a small rural village named Giprol, where the Aimar and Tardin Tara own a modest Chocobo™ farm.

Somewhere deep beneath the hopelessness she found a hidden resolve; she would throw every last ounce of energy in her eight-year-old body into finding him.  Random passersbys were conscripted into a search party to comb the town; just before the sun passed below the horizon, a shout went up from Cassowary Hill; Mr. Sniggles was found! He had hurt his leg climbing through a fence and was stuck.  Tesh cried with joy as she hugged Sniggles, and the town gathered in impromptu celebration.  Belatedly, she noticed that from their elevated position they could see a group of figures traveling across the plains in the distance.  “Daddy, who’re they?” Her father Tardin explained how the nearby settlement of Elves was marching to war against their ancient enemies, the Drow.  It took several more questions before she understood, with dawning horror, what he meant.  “You mean... people hurt each other... On purpose?!?”  Tesh was clearly about to cry again, so Tardin rushed to hug her, but was instead startled when her mood swung with a shout.  “I won’t let the Mr. Sniggles’ of the world be hurt by jerky old fences.
